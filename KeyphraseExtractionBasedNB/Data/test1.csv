"carbon dioxide laser vaporization in early glottic carcinoma. objective: presently, widely employed treatment modalities for early glottic carcinoma include radiation therapy, surgical excision, and carbon dioxide laser excision. all these treatments have good oncological results, but poor or questionable functional results in terms of quality of voice and mucosal wave patterns as seen via a laryngostroboscope. we assessed the oncological and functional results of carbon dioxide laser vaporization of the diseased mucosa as a more conservative treatment alternative. design: case series. setting: department of otolaryngology每head and neck surgery in a tertiary care center. patients: thirty-three patients with early glottic carcinoma (carcinoma in situ and t1a squamous cell carcinoma) who were referred to our center in the period from 1986 through 1990 were selected for carbon dioxide laser vaporization treatment on the criterion of a still recognizable mucosal wave pattern of the affected vocal fold via a laryngostroboscope. main outcome measures: local tumor control, voice quality, and a good appearance via a laryngostroboscope. results: two patients were excluded from evaluation because a simultaneously diagnosed, incurable second primary tumor precluded frequent follow-up. of the remaining 31 patients seen during a median follow-up period of 58 months, seven patients died of unrelated causes. a local recurrence of disease developed in two patients and was treated by radiation therapy. a recurrence of disease developed again in one of these patients but was successfully treated by total laryngectomy. overall, local control of disease was achieved in all patients, with a 97% laryngeal preservation rate. functional results in terms of voice quality were good in 97% of the patients, 75% of whom even retained a normal voice. normal or near normal laryngostroboscopic appearance was achieved in 68% of all patients. conclusion: carbon dioxide laser

"swainsonine augments the cytotoxicity of human lymphokine-activated killer cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells. objective: swainsonine (sw), an inhibitor of mammalian golgi 汐-mannosidase ii, blocks the processing of high mannose to complex type oligosaccharides. in this study, the effect of sw on the cytotoxicity of lymphokine-activated killer (lak) cells against autologous thyroid cancer was investigated. design: peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with thyroid cancer were incubated with recombinant interleukin 2 (100 u/ml) and 0.5 mg/l of sw for 7 days, and thyroid cancer cells obtained from surgical specimens were pretreated with sw (0.5 mg/l) for 18 hours. the cytotoxicity of sw-treated lak cells against tumor cells tested in a standard 4-hour radioactive chromium cr 51 release assay. results: the cytotoxicity of sw-treated lak cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells was found to be significantly greater than that of standard lak cells incubated with interleukin 2 alone. the n-汐-benzyloxycarbonyl每l-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase activity of lak cells, this activity being a cytotoxic factor that is necessary for the lethal hit stage, was also increased by sw treatment. further, thyroid cancer cells incubated with sw, as compared with nontreated tumor cells, showed much higher susceptibility to lak killing. conclusions: our results suggest that sw might have potential immunomodulatory properties in the treatment of thyroid cancer.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:389-394)",thyroid cancer;;thyroid cancer cells;;lymphokine-activated killer cells;;autologous thyroid cancer;;lymphokine-activated killer;;autologous thyroid cancer cells;;sw-treated lymphokine-activated killer cells;;tumor cells;;swainsonine;;standard 4-hour radioactive chromium cr;;benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase activity;;human lymphokine-activated killer cells;;complex type oligosaccharides;;nontreated tumor cells;;standard lymphokine-activated killer cells,"swainsonine augments the cytotoxicity of human lymphokine-activated killer cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells.;;objective: swainsonine (sw), an inhibitor of mammalian golgi 汐-mannosidase ii, blocks the processing of high mannose to complex type oligosaccharides.;;in this study, the effect of sw on the cytotoxicity of lymphokine-activated killer (lak) cells against autologous thyroid cancer was investigated.;;design: peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with thyroid cancer were incubated with recombinant interleukin 2 (100 u/ml) and 0.5 mg/l of sw for 7 days, and thyroid cancer cells obtained from surgical specimens were pretreated with sw (0.5 mg/l) for 18 hours.;;the cytotoxicity of sw-treated lak cells against tumor cells tested in a standard 4-hour radioactive chromium cr 51 release assay.;;results: the cytotoxicity of sw-treated lak cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells was found to be significantly greater than that of standard lak cells incubated with interleukin 2 alone.;;the n-汐-benzyloxycarbonyl每l-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase activity of lak cells, this activity being a cytotoxic factor that is necessary for the lethal hit stage, was also increased by sw treatment.;;further, thyroid cancer cells incubated with sw, as compared with nontreated tumor cells, showed much higher susceptibility to lak killing.;;conclusions: our results suggest that sw might have potential immunomodulatory properties in the treatment of thyroid cancer.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1994;120:389-394)",cancer cells;;n-汐-benzyloxycarbonyl每l-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase activity;;release assay;;high mannose;;sw treatment;;cytotoxic factor;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;design;;swainsonine;;swainsonine augments;;interleukin;;surgical specimens;;conclusions;;autologous thyroid cancer cells;;treatment;;objective;;u/ml );;blocks;;much higher susceptibility;;lymphokine-activated killer;;lak;;autologous thyroid cancer;;processing;;effect;;results;;hours;;lak cells;;nontreated tumor cells;;alone;;killing;;sw-treated lak cells;;radioactive chromium cr;;cytotoxicity;;thyroid cancer;;mammalian golgi 汐-mannosidase ii;;tumor cells;;standard lak cells;;lethal hit stage;;type oligosaccharides;;study;;potential immunomodulatory properties;;sw;;days;;human lymphokine-activated killer cells;;recombinant interleukin;;patients;;mg/l );;activity;;inhibitor;;cells;;peripheral blood lymphocytes

"electrocochleographic monitoring in endolymphatic sac surgery for meniere's disease. objective: to determine the efficacy of intraoperative electrocochleographic monitoring during endolymphatic sac每ballooning surgery for meniere's disease. design: at each of five surgical steps, the eighth nerve action potential (ap) amplitude and latency, summating potential (sp) amplitude, and sp/ap amplitude ratio were recorded. data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance. patients: electrocochleographs were successfully recorded in 97 patients during endolymphatic sac每ballooning surgery. forty patients had an abnormal baseline ratio (group 1), and 57 patients had a normal baseline ratio. results: data showed that the sp/ap amplitude ratio reductions were significant only in group 1 patients. the sp/ap amplitude ratio was reduced in two thirds of the group 1 patients and unchanged in roughly the same proportion of group 2 patients. a significant reduction of sp/ap amplitude ratios was found to be always associated with prominent sp/ap ratios at the baseline, irrespective of glycerol test results, and only in cases of classic meniere's disease, indicating that this dominant ratio is a very reliable indicator of meniere's disease and endolymphatic hydrops. importantly, reductions of sp/ap amplitude ratios were observed at every step to be consistently due to ap increase rather than sp decrease. conclusions: it is theorized that the dominant sp/ap amplitude ratio found in patients with meniere's disease and endolymphatic hydrops is caused by the inhibition of ap activity rather than by the enhancement of the sp resulting from the displacement of the basilar membrane toward the scala tympani owing to hydropic endolymph, as is generally believed. we conclude that electrocochleograpic monitoring is useful durig endolymphatic sac每ballooning surgery to provide a definitive delineation of the endolymphatic sac and its lumen;

"use of decision analysis in planning a management strategy for the stage no neck. objective: there are three major strategies in the treatment of patients with a stage no neck with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck: elective neck dissection, elective neck irradiation, and observation. each has appropriate salvage strategies in the event of local recurrence. we used decision analysis to determine the optimal strategy for neck treatment as a function of the probability of occult cervical metastasis. data sources: we used the bibliographies of current articles and books to access clinical studies of patients with stage no neck cancer. study selection: studies that included large numbers of patients and contained a minimum 2-year follow-up, with results analyzed in terms of outcome as a function of stage of neck disease, were included. data extraction: specific data points were extracted from the studies independently by multiple observers, and mean values were used in the decision analysis. data synthesis: a decision tree was constructed with use of a computer model to compare the three management strategies. probabilities of each of the possible events depicted in the trees were inserted into the tree structure. these probabilities were gleaned from the literature as described above. a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal threshold for treatment of the neck. conclusion: a patient with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and stage no neck status should be observed if the probability of occult cervical metastasis is less than 20%. if the probability is greater than 20%, treatment of the neck is warranted. the treatment plan should ideally involve a single modality of therapy;

for an average total dose of 64.8 gy, and 34 patients received 1.8 gy per fraction for an average total dose of 66.7 gy. we also calculated overall survival statistics. combining the clinical data from our series and those of patients from other series (171 total patients), we analyzed the tumor response curve and doubling time for early glottic carcinoma by using a time-dependent, linear quadratic equation model. the analysis is valid for the typical range of radioresponsiveness for most tumors in healthy tissue. results: using statistical z analysis, we noted a significant difference in the local control rates at 5 years, with better local control in the group that received 2.0 gy per fraction (100% vs 70%). our results for the calculated doubling time and tumor response curves correspond with experimental values for in vitro squamous cell carcinoma systems. conclusion: it appears from the literature and from our data that the control rates for t1, no, mo glottic carcinoma

"relation of dna ploidy and proliferation rate to radiation sensitivity in squamous carcinoma cell lines. objective: according to some clinical reports, dna aneuploidy of squamous cell carcinomas is related to a more favorable response to radiotherapy than dna diploidy, but it is not known whether this depends on differences in intrinsic cellular radiation sensitivity or on other factors involved during the course of radiotherapy. design: using flow cytometry, we analyzed 30 newly established squamous carcinoma cell lines derived from head and neck carcinoma, and compared the nuclear dna content with the inherent radiosensitivity and with the average doubling time determined from the in vitro growth curves. results: the nuclear dna content expressed as the ratio between the g0/g1 peak of the cell line and the peak formed by chicken red blood cells varied from 3.13 to 6.41. the dna content of cells obtained from nonmalignant lesions by fine-needle aspiration biopsy was from 2.66 to 2.80. no correlation was found between the nuclear dna content and the inherent radiosensitivity of the carcinoma cells. conclusions: the result suggests that the intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity of carcinomas does not increase in parallel with an increasing nuclear dna content. nor does the in vitro proliferation rate associate with either the nuclear dna content or inherent radiosensitivity.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:750-754)",dna content;;nuclear dna content;;cell line;;inherent radiosensitivity;;squamous carcinoma cell lines;;radiation sensitivity;;proliferation rate;;dna ploidy and proliferation rate;;intrinsic cellular radiation sensitivity;;increasing nuclear dna content;;chicken red blood cells;;squamous cell carcinomas;;proliferation rate associate;;intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity;;fine-needle aspiration biopsy;;dna ploidy,"relation of dna ploidy and proliferation rate to radiation sensitivity in squamous carcinoma cell lines.;;objective: according to some clinical reports, dna aneuploidy of squamous cell carcinomas is related to a more favorable response to radiotherapy than dna diploidy, but it is not known whether this depends on differences in intrinsic cellular radiation sensitivity or on other factors involved during the course of radiotherapy.;;design: using flow cytometry, we analyzed 30 newly established squamous carcinoma cell lines derived from head and neck carcinoma, and compared the nuclear dna content with the inherent radiosensitivity and with the average doubling time determined from the in vitro growth curves.;;results: the nuclear dna content expressed as the ratio between the g0/g1 peak of the cell line and the peak formed by chicken red blood cells varied from 3.13 to 6.41. the dna content of cells obtained from nonmalignant lesions by fine-needle aspiration biopsy was from 2.66 to 2.80. no correlation was found between the nuclear dna content and the inherent radiosensitivity of the carcinoma cells.;;conclusions: the result suggests that the intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity of carcinomas does not increase in parallel with an increasing nuclear dna content.;;nor does the in vitro proliferation rate associate with either the nuclear dna content or inherent radiosensitivity.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1994;120:750-754)",radiation sensitivity;;cell line;;results;;squamous cell carcinomas;;radiotherapy;;course;;depends;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;design;;result;;intrinsic cellular radiation sensitivity;;inherent radiosensitivity;;nuclear dna content;;dna ploidy;;carcinoma cells;;other factors;;squamous carcinoma cell lines;;flow cytometry;;ratio;;conclusions;;carcinomas;;dna aneuploidy;;blood cells;;objective;;vitro proliferation rate associate;;head;;differences;;fine-needle aspiration biopsy;;vitro growth curves;;average doubling time;;intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity;;dna diploidy;;parallel;;g0/g1 peak;;dna content;;proliferation rate;;neck carcinoma;;cells;;clinical reports;;correlation;;relation;;favorable response;;nonmalignant lesions;;peak
"h-ras oncogene mutation and human papillomavirus infection in oral carcinomas. objective: previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that transfection of an activated ras gene induces malignant transformation in epithelial cell lines infected with the human papillomavirus (hpv). the results of these studies support the hypothesis that hpv may co-operate with an activated ras gene in epithelial tumor carcinogenesis. to test this hypothesis in head and neck cancers, we screened 35 oral carcinomas for the presence of hpv dna and for a mutated h-ras gene. design: the design of the study was a screening survey type. twenty-seven oral squamous cell carcinomas and eight verrucous carcinomas were analyzed for the presence of hpv dna using the polymerase chain reaction, followed by southern blot and probe hybridization. the tumors were also screened for point mutations of the h-ras gene using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: six (22%) of the 27 oral squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated point mutation in the h-ras gene. in addition, six tumors (22%) were positive for hpv dna, with three tumors (11%) demonstrating both hpv dna and h-ras gene point mutation. while the rate of simultaneous hpv infection and ras gene activation by point mutation was 11% in oral squamous cell carcinomas, 25% of oral verrucous carcinomas contained both hpv dna and mutation in the h-ras gene. conclusions: these results suggest a stronger association between hpv infection and activation of the h-ras gene in oral verrucous carcinomas. these results continue to confirm the multihit hypothesis of tumorigenesis and suggest that in some cases of oral cancer at least two of these events are h-ras gene mutation and hpv infection.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:755-760)",ras gene;;h-ras gene;;hpv dna;;point mutation;;oral squamous cell carcinomas;;verrucous carcinomas;;hpv infection;;activated ras gene;;oral verrucous carcinomas;;polymerase chain reaction;;human papillomavirus;;oral carcinomas;;southern blot and probe hybridization;;restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis;;twenty-seven oral squamous cell carcinomas,"h-ras oncogene mutation and human papillomavirus infection in oral carcinomas.;;objective: previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that transfection of an activated ras gene induces malignant transformation in epithelial cell lines infected with the human papillomavirus (hpv).;;the results of these studies support the hypothesis that hpv may co-operate with an activated ras gene in epithelial tumor carcinogenesis.;;to test this hypothesis in head and neck cancers, we screened 35 oral carcinomas for the presence of hpv dna and for a mutated h-ras gene.;;design: the design of the study was a screening survey type.;;twenty-seven oral squamous cell carcinomas and eight verrucous carcinomas were analyzed for the presence of hpv dna using the polymerase chain reaction, followed by southern blot and probe hybridization.;;the tumors were also screened for point mutations of the h-ras gene using the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.;;results: six (22%) of the 27 oral squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated point mutation in the h-ras gene.;;in addition, six tumors (22%) were positive for hpv dna, with three tumors (11%) demonstrating both hpv dna and h-ras gene point mutation.;;while the rate of simultaneous hpv infection and ras gene activation by point mutation was 11% in oral squamous cell carcinomas, 25% of oral verrucous carcinomas contained both hpv dna and mutation in the h-ras gene.;;conclusions: these results suggest a stronger association between hpv infection and activation of the h-ras gene in oral verrucous carcinomas.;;these results continue to confirm the multihit hypothesis of tumorigenesis and suggest that in some cases of oral cancer at least two of these events are h-ras gene mutation and hpv infection.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1994;120:755-760)",oral squamous cell carcinomas;;hpv dna;;presence;;results;;human papillomavirus;;rate;;oral cancer;;design;;studies support;;human papillomavirus infection;;tumorigenesis;;restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis;;oral verrucous carcinomas;;vitro studies;;tumors;;stronger association;;h-ras gene mutation;;h-ras gene;;southern blot;;twenty-seven oral squamous cell carcinomas;;addition;;verrucous carcinomas;;hpv infection;;hpv;;screening survey type;;mutation;;simultaneous hpv infection;;point mutations;;objective;;events;;transformation;;hybridization;;transfection;;oral carcinomas;;neck cancers;;conclusions;;epithelial tumor carcinogenesis;;test;;mutated h-ras gene;;point mutation;;ras gene;;polymerase chain reaction;;cases;;h-ras gene point mutation;;study;;activation;;ras gene induces;;epithelial cell lines;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;hypothesis;;multihit hypothesis;;head;;h-ras oncogene mutation;;ras

"problems with tracheoesophageal fistula voice restoration in totally laryngectomized patients: a review of 95 cases. objectives: tracheoesophageal fistula (tef) construction, performed during or after total laryngectomy, is used for voice and speech restoration but has been associated with mild to severe complications. our goal was to study the successes and complications in the application of this technique to restore voice function after laryngectomy in 95 consecutive patients. research design: retrospective cohort study with a mean follow-up time of 3.5 years. setting: five medical facilities in northern california: the veterans affairs medical centers in san francisco and martinez, the kaiser permanente medical center in oakland, and private practice offices in san francisco and pinole. patients: ninety-five patients (90 men and five women) who had undergone total laryngectomy with subsequent or primary tef construction. patients' ages ranged from 35 to 80 years. interventions: three- or two-layer closure was used, depending on whether tef construction was done as a secondary or a primary procedure. most patients underwent radiation therapy, and most used surface or intraoral electrolarynx devices before tef construction. insufflation tests were performed by clinicians, or self-insufflation tests were performed by the patient. patients' voices were recorded and analyzed. in many cases, respiratory and pulmonary function studies were performed before and after total laryngectomy or tef. blom-singer and groningen voice prostheses were used. main outcome measures: voice restoration was considered successful when the patient was able to communicate effectively via the tef. results: approximately 92% of patients who underwent tef construction and had voice prostheses placed were considered to be successfully rehabilitated. complications ranged from mild to severe and included problems with predictive values obtained during insufflation, fistula retention, tef angulation shifts, fungal colonization of the prosthesis, valve retention problems, difficulty with digital occlusion, pressure necrosis, postradiation necrosis, dysphagia, phonatory gagging, emesis, gastric distention, pouching, stenosis, infection, hypertrophy, shunt insufficiency, persistent spasm, myotomy, inadvertent fistula closure, and aspiration of the

"safe and dependable harvesting of large outer-table calvarial bone grafts. a review of a new technique for the harvesting of split (outer-table) calvarial bone grafts is presented. the use of calvarial bone grafts for facial reconstructive surgery has become more commonplace in recent years. low donor site morbidity and availability of adequate amounts of membranous bone in close proximity to the facial surgical site make its use particularly desirable. unfortunately, the occasional complications associated with the harvesting of these grafts can be severe, including dural tears and/or hemorrhage from a dural sinus, as well as late hematomas and meningitis. the technique herein described involves the use of a long malleable blade in a reciprocating saw. the malleability of the blade allows it to conform to the shape of the skull while elevating split grafts almost as wide as the blade is long. twenty separate grafts were harvested in 18 patients. the largest measured 7℅10 cm. the grafts were further contoured after harvesting and used in 37 sites. no grafts splintered, and no donor site complications were encountered. while care must of course be exercised with any technique, this one is believed to be a safe and dependable method for the harvesting of split calvarial grafts for facial reconstruction.

method. comparisons between survival curves were carried out by the log-rank statistic and cox regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of prognostic factors. results: the 5-year cause-specific survival was 62%, with a local relapse rate of 41% and distant relapse rate of 31%. extension to adjacent structures, high grade, and large lesion size were associated with poorer

"rigid fixation of vascularized bone grafts in mandibular reconstruction. objective: to evaluate the nature of complications and complication rates with the use of three different reconstruction plates for the rigid fixation of vascularized bone grafts in oromandibular reconstruction. design: we conducted a case series of 95 patients over a 6-year period, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months and a maximum follow-up of 66 months. setting: academic tertiary referral medical center. patients: forty-eight patients had vascularized bone grafts fixated to native mandible with ao stainless steel reconstruction plates; 25 patients, with ao titanium plates; and 22 patients, with titanium hollow screw reconstruction plates (thorps). types of vascularized flaps, mandibular defects to be reconstructed, and use of radiation therapy were similar among the three groups. intervention: the surgical approach involved oromandibular reconstruction with a vascularized bone graft rigidly fixated with a reconstruction plate. outcome measures: clinically and radiographically noted complications and resultant treatment. results: in the grafts fixated with ao stainless steel reconstruction plates, three plate fractures, seven instances of loose screws, eight plate exposures, and two cases of nonunion occurred. no cases of plate fracture or nonunion occurred in the titanium or thorp groups. one titanium plate and two thorps were exposed during the study period. one instance of loose screws occurred in the titanium group;

"outcome and complications of extended cranial-base resection requiring microvascular free-tissue transfer. objectives: to determine the complications of extensive cranial-base resection requiring free-tissue transfer (ftt) and the effect of these resections on local control and survival among patients with malignant neoplasms of the skull base. background: before the advent of ftt, cranial-base surgery was often limited by our inability to adequately repair defects comprising communication between the central nervous system and upper aerodigestive tract. the use of ftt in cranial-base resections was therefore assessed to determine whether the improved procedure (ie, extensive resections) would improve local control and prolong survival. design: a retrospective review of 39 consecutive craniofacial resections with ftt reconstruction in patients with malignant neoplasms involving the cranial base. patients: all 39 patients had malignant neoplasms, including 20 squamous cell carcinomas, eight basal cell carcinomas, two melanomas, two neuroendocrine carcinomas, two adenoid cystic carcinomas, and various other malignant neoplasms. resections involved the anterior, middle, or posterior cranial fossa in 19 patients (49%), 10 patients (26%), and three patients (8%) of cases, respectively. the remaining seven surgeries (18%) involved resection of more than one of these cranial base sites. results: early (<14 days after surgery) complications occurred in 14 (36%) of 39 patients. major complications included failure of microvascular anastomosis (n=1), pneumonitis (n=3), perioperative myocardial infarction (n=1), and cerebrovascular accident (n=1). the microvascular anastomosis failure was promptly treated with surgical intervention. two patients (5%) experienced late postoperative complications; one had cellulitis at the donor site, and the other had pneumonitis. no perioperative deaths or complications such as meningitis, epidural abscess, or tension pneumocephalus occurred. the 2-year disease-specific survival rate was 55%, and the 2-year local control rate, 49%; both were determined by the kaplan-meier method. the nine patients who died of their disease had a median survival of 9 months. logrank testing showed that pathologically positive margins and transdural pathology were the most significant predictors of local recurrence and death of disease. conclusions: contemporary surgical approaches provide an opportunity for wide surgical excision of dura and skull-base structures that normally separate the intracranial and extracranial cavities. these major skull-base resections can be reconstructed safely and effectively with ftt. patients with malignant neoplasms of the dura and skull base should be approached with the understanding that transdural disease portends an increased risk of local recurrence and death of disease.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:1253-1257)","malignant neoplasms;;local control;;free-tissue transfer;;resections;;local recurrence;;microvascular anastomosis;;local control and survival;;free-tissue transfer , cranial-base surgery;;perioperative deaths or complications;;2-year local control rate;;intracranial and extracranial cavities;;consecutive craniofacial resections;;squamous cell carcinomas","outcome and complications of extended cranial-base resection requiring microvascular free-tissue transfer.;;objectives: to determine the complications of extensive cranial-base resection requiring free-tissue transfer (ftt) and the effect of these resections on local control and survival among patients with malignant neoplasms of the skull base.;;background: before the advent of ftt, cranial-base surgery was often limited by our inability to adequately repair defects comprising communication between the central nervous system and upper aerodigestive tract.;;the use of ftt in cranial-base resections was therefore assessed to determine whether the improved procedure (ie, extensive resections) would improve local control and prolong survival.;;design: a retrospective review of 39 consecutive craniofacial resections with ftt reconstruction in patients with malignant neoplasms involving the cranial base.;;patients: all 39 patients had malignant neoplasms, including 20 squamous cell carcinomas, eight basal cell carcinomas, two melanomas, two neuroendocrine carcinomas, two adenoid cystic carcinomas, and various other malignant neoplasms.;;resections involved the anterior, middle, or posterior cranial fossa in 19 patients (49%), 10 patients (26%), and three patients (8%) of cases, respectively.;;the remaining seven surgeries (18%) involved resection of more than one of these cranial base sites.;;results: early (<14 days after surgery) complications occurred in 14 (36%) of 39 patients.;;major complications included failure of microvascular anastomosis (n=1), pneumonitis (n=3), perioperative myocardial infarction (n=1), and cerebrovascular accident (n=1).;;the microvascular anastomosis failure was promptly treated with surgical intervention.;;two patients (5%) experienced late postoperative complications;

"her-2/neu oncogene characterization in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. objective: to characterize the her-2/neu oncogene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) cell lines and tumor tissue specimens. design: molecular analysis of her-2/neu oncogene amplification and expression in hnscc cell lines by southern, northern, and western blot techniques, and her-2/neu oncoprotein expression in hnscc tumor tissue sections by immunohistochemical analysis. specimens: eleven hnscc cell lines, eight paired samples of frozen hnscc tumor tissue specimens and adjacent nonmalignant mucosa, and 38 paraffinembedded slides derived from hnscc tumor specimens (including those from which the cell lines were derived) were analyzed. results: southern blot analysis showed twofold her-2/neu gene amplification in two (18%) of the 11 hnscc cell lines, mda-1386 and tu-167. northern blot analysis showed messenger rna overexpression in the same two cell lines, and to a lesser degree in mda-1483. western blot analysis showed high levels of her-2/neu oncoprotein expression in two (18%) of the 11 cell lines (mda-1386 and tu-167), a moderate level of protein expression in one cell line (9%) (mda-1483), and low levels of protein expression in eight cell lines (73%) some her-2/neu protein expression was seen in all of the hnscc cell lines. immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissue sections from which the cell lines were derived corroborated the western blot results. western blot analysis of frozen primary tumor specimens showed her-2/neu oncoprotein overexpression in two (25%) of eight specimens. immunohistochemical analysis showed high levels of protein expression in six (16%) of the 38 tumor tissue slides, moderate levels in 12 (31%), and low levels in 20 (53%). conclusions: the her-2/neu oncogene is overexpressed in a subset of hnscc tumors and cell lines. the results from western blot and immunohistochemical analyses underscore a variable her2/neu

"interferon gamma enhances lymphokine-activated killer cell adhesion but not lysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. objectives: to determine if treatment with recombinant human interferon gamma (rhuifn-污) increases the adhesion to, and lysis of, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (scc) cells by lymphokine-activated killer (lak) and peripheral blood mononuclear (pbm) effector cells in vitro and to evaluate the role of cell surface adhesion molecules in these processes. design: two human scc cell lines, jhu-020-scc and jhu-022-scc, were used. lymphokine-activated killer cells were generated by interleukin-2 stimulation of pbm cells obtained from the hemapheresis blood donor packs of healthy individuals. adhesion assays were performed to assess the level of binding of both effector populations to scc cells, which were treated with either fresh media or rhuifn-污 (100 u/ml). binding was measured by flow cytometric detection of effector cells labeled with fluorescein-conjugated anti-cd45 monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibodies to the cell adhesion molecules hla-dr, lymphocyte function〞associated antigen 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were used in blocking experiments to determine their contribution to the process of effector-scc cell adhesion. cytotoxicity experiments were performed using a colorimetric assay to determine the cytotoxic response generated by lak and pbm cells against scc cells, with and without prior rhuifn-污 treatment of the tumor cells. main outcome measures: effector cell binding level and percent cytotoxicity of scc cells. results: recombinant human interferon gamma treatment of jhu-020-scc cells resulted in increased adhesion to both lak cells and pbm cells (p<.001). the presence of anti〞lymphocyte function〞associated antigen 1 antibody resulted in elimination of the enhanced adhesion seen with rhuifn-污 pretreatment of scc cells (p=.03), but antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and hla-dr did not reduce the level of effector binding. the greatest cytotoxic response against both jhu-020-scc and jhu-022-scc was seen with lak cells (p≒.001). pretreatment of tumor targets by rhuifn-污 (100 u/ml) resulted in no enhancement of cytotoxic response by either lak or pbm cells; at the effector-target ratio of 30:1, there was a significant decrease in lak cell〞mediated cytotoxic response against rhuifn-污每treated scc cells (p≒.02). conclusions: recombinant human interferon gamma treatment of head and neck scc cells does increase binding of both lak cells and pbm cells to tumor cells, in part via the lymphocyte function〞associated antigen 1 ligand mechanism. the cytotoxic effect mediated by lak cells against head and neck scc cells is reduced after rhuifn-污 treatment, suggesting that the activity of this cytokine may be more important in regulating antigen-specific cytotoxic response mediated by cytotoxic t-lymphocytes.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:1271-1275)",squamous cell carcinoma cells;;peripheral blood mononuclear cells;;cytotoxic response;;lymphokine-activated killer;;lymphokine-activated killer cells;;rhuifn-污;;squamous cell carcinoma;;peripheral blood mononuclear;;lymphocyte function-associated antigen;;neck squamous cell carcinoma;;jhu-020-scc and jhu-022-scc;;intercellular adhesion molecule;;neck squamous cell carcinoma cells,"interferon gamma enhances lymphokine-activated killer cell adhesion but not lysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.;;objectives: to determine if treatment with recombinant human interferon gamma (rhuifn-污) increases the adhesion to, and lysis of, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (scc) cells by lymphokine-activated killer (lak) and peripheral blood mononuclear (pbm) effector cells in vitro and to evaluate the role of cell surface adhesion molecules in these processes.;;design: two human scc cell lines, jhu-020-scc and jhu-022-scc, were used.;;lymphokine-activated killer cells were generated by interleukin-2 stimulation of pbm cells obtained from the hemapheresis blood donor packs of healthy individuals.;;adhesion assays were performed to assess the level of binding of both effector populations to scc cells, which were treated with either fresh media or rhuifn-污 (100 u/ml).;;binding was measured by flow cytometric detection of effector cells labeled with fluorescein-conjugated anti-cd45 monoclonal antibody.;;monoclonal antibodies to the cell adhesion molecules hla-dr, lymphocyte function〞associated antigen 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were used in blocking experiments to determine their contribution to the process of effector-scc cell adhesion.;;cytotoxicity experiments were performed using a colorimetric assay to determine the cytotoxic response generated by lak and pbm cells against scc cells, with and without prior rhuifn-污 treatment of the tumor cells.;;main outcome measures: effector cell binding level and percent cytotoxicity of scc cells.;;results: recombinant human interferon gamma treatment of jhu-020-scc cells resulted in increased adhesion to both lak cells and pbm cells (p<.001).;;the presence of anti〞lymphocyte function〞associated antigen 1 antibody resulted in elimination of the enhanced adhesion seen with rhuifn-污 pretreatment of scc cells (p=.03), but antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and hla-dr did not reduce the level of effector binding.;;the greatest cytotoxic response against both jhu-020-scc and jhu-022-scc was seen with lak cells (p≒.001).;;pretreatment of tumor targets by rhuifn-污 (100 u/ml) resulted in no enhancement of cytotoxic response by either lak or pbm cells;

"adhesion of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma to endothelial cells: the missing links. objectives: to examine the direct adhesion of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) cells to basal and cytokine-activated human endothelial cells and to determine the cell adhesion molecules (cams) that mediate binding under these two conditions. design: using an established model of tumor metastasis, the adhesion of four hnscc cell lines to human umbilical vein endothelial cell (huvec) monolayers was examined, with and without pretreatment of huvec with tumor necrosis factor 汐 (tnf-汐). surface cam expression of hnscc and huvec was determined by flow cytometry, and the results were used to direct studies of adhesion blocking using monoclonal antibodies. the contribution of various cam to hnscc binding of basal and cytokine-activated human endothelial cells in vitro was established. main outcome measures: adhesion of hnscc to huvec monolayers was determined by a sodium chromate cr 51-labeling assay in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibodies directed against specific cams. results: four hnscc cell lines were shown by flow cytometry to constitutively express the following cams: intercellular cam-1, cd44, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3, integrin chains 汐6 and 汕1, and sialyl lewisx. no cell lines expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 or the integrin subunit 汐4. adhesion of jhu-011-scc to tnf-汐-activated huvec was enhanced above the untreated level in a time-dependent manner, with maximal adhesion at 12 hours. this increase correlated with endothelial-selectin expression by huvec and hnscc expression of its ligand sialyl lewisx. monoclonal antibody to sialyl lewisx blocked the increased adhesion to tnf-汐-activated huvec in two of four hnscc cell lines. monoclonal antibody to the 汐6 integrin reduced binding to tnf-汐-activated and nonactivated huvec and to subendothelial matrix, but not to fibronectin. conclusions: studies of four hnscc cell lines disclosed a consistent and distinctive pattern of adhesion molecule expression. the 汐6 integrin subunit may be involved in direct adhesion to nonactivated and cytokine-activated endothelial cells or to laminin present on the endothelial surface. sialyl lewisx was more specifically involved in the increased adhesion to cytokine-activated huvec. this suggests that the sialyl

"interleukin-8 expression by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. objective: to test the hypothesis that interleukin-8 (il-8) is produced by human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (hnsccas) and may therefore be a possible mediator for lymphocyte recruitment and neovascularization by these tumors. methods: nine fresh samples of hnscca were analyzed for expression of il-8 antigen using radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical staining techniques. also, four short-term primary cultures of hnscca and two continuous hnscca cell lines were then analyzed for production of il-8 expression under both baseline conditions and following stimulation with other cytokines. results: the il-8 antigen was detected in all fresh rumor homogenates by radioimmunoassay (5.58 to 331.69 ng of il-8 per gram of tissue), and immunohistochemical results localized staining predominantly within the tumor cells. primary cultures of hnscca and continuous hnscca cell lines produced only low levels of il-8 (0.04 to 4.49 ng of il-8 per 106 cells) under baseline (unstimulated) conditions. stimulation of both primary cultures and cell lines with interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor induced significant increases in il-8 antigen, while other cytokines failed to induce a significant increase. conclusions: this study demonstrates that il-8 antigen is expressed by hnscca in vivo, and that cultured hnscca in vitro can be stimulated to express il-8 antigen by both interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor. local production of il-8 by hnscca cells, and its regulation by other cytokines, may be important in both the lymphocyte recruitment and tumor neovascularization seen in hnscca, and may thus ultimately affect the natural history of the disease.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:202-209)",hnscca;;il-8;;il-8 antigen;;cell lines;;primary cultures;;interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor;;neck squamous cell carcinoma;;continuous hnscca cell lines;;tumor necrosis factor;;lymphocyte recruitment;;il-8 per;;significant increase;;lymphocyte recruitment and tumor neovascularization;;two continuous hnscca cell lines;;radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical staining techniques;;primary cultures and cell lines;;interleukin-8;;neck squamous cell carcinomas,"interleukin-8 expression by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.;;objective: to test the hypothesis that interleukin-8 (il-8) is produced by human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (hnsccas) and may therefore be a possible mediator for lymphocyte recruitment and neovascularization by these tumors.;;methods: nine fresh samples of hnscca were analyzed for expression of il-8 antigen using radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemical staining techniques.;;also, four short-term primary cultures of hnscca and two continuous hnscca cell lines were then analyzed for production of il-8 expression under both baseline conditions and following stimulation with other cytokines.;;results: the il-8 antigen was detected in all fresh rumor homogenates by radioimmunoassay (5.58 to 331.69 ng of il-8 per gram of tissue), and immunohistochemical results localized staining predominantly within the tumor cells.;;primary cultures of hnscca and continuous hnscca cell lines produced only low levels of il-8 (0.04 to 4.49 ng of il-8 per 106 cells) under baseline (unstimulated) conditions.;;stimulation of both primary cultures and cell lines with interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor induced significant increases in il-8 antigen, while other cytokines failed to induce a significant increase.;;conclusions: this study demonstrates that il-8 antigen is expressed by hnscca in vivo, and that cultured hnscca in vitro can be stimulated to express il-8 antigen by both interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor.;;local production of il-8 by hnscca cells, and its regulation by other cytokines, may be important in both the lymphocyte recruitment and tumor neovascularization seen in hnscca, and may thus ultimately affect the natural history of the disease.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:202-209)",hnscca cells;;methods;;neovascularization;;results;;baseline conditions;;tissue;;possible mediator;;neck squamous cell carcinomas;;interleukin-8 expression;;human head;;short-term primary cultures;;tumor neovascularization;;baseline;;conclusions;;low levels;;ng;;stimulation;;regulation;;production;;immunohistochemical results;;antigen;;test;;conditions;;immunohistochemical staining techniques;;hnscca;;continuous hnscca cell lines;;head;;other cytokines;;express;;fresh rumor homogenates;;local production;;neck squamous cell carcinoma;;vitro;;objective;;primary cultures;;hypothesis;;fresh samples;;il-8 expression;;tumor necrosis factor;;hnsccas;;il-8 antigen;;tumor cells;;tumors;;significant increases;;lymphocyte recruitment;;disease;;vivo;;radioimmunoassay;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;gram;;natural history;;study;;significant increase;;expression;;cells;;cell lines

preservation with historical age-, sex-, stage-, and site-matched controls who underwent laryngectomy for cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx. design: fifty-five patients with stage iii or iv laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma were prospectively entered into a protocol to receive three cycles of cisplatin (㊣bleomycin sulfate) and fluorouracil and radiation therapy from 1986 to 1991 (group 1). following two cycles of chemotherapy, the clinical tumor response was assessed and responders received a third cycle of chemotherapy followed by definitive radiation therapy. nonresponders underwent surgical salvage. two patients in the surgical control group were matched to each protocol patient (n=110, group 2) regarding site, stage, sex, and age (㊣7 years) without knowledge of patient outcome. setting: a tertiary cancer referral center, the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center, houston results: following chemotherapy, the tumor response rate for group 1 was complete in 38% and partial in 31%. with a median follow-up of 24 months (group 1) and 37 months (group 2), the kaplan-meier 2-year disease-specific survival for group 1 and 2 was 63% and 74%, respectively (p=.251). among group 1 patients, 67% retained their larynges. local recurrences were more frequent among the laryngeal preservation group (p=.001), whereas distant metastasis was more frequent among controls (p=.35). thirty-three percent (18/55) of group 1 patients required total laryngectomy. examining these subsets of patients showed that of the 67% (n=37) of patients who retained their larynges, their 2-year survival was 56%, not significantly different from their respective controls (n=74), 71%. additionally, 2-year survival among the 18 group 1 patients who required salvage laryngectomy was 75% as compared with 80% for their matched controls (n=36). conclusions: these results document the results of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of patients with advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in preserving the larynx. although local control is significantly compromised among these patients, there is no compromise in overall survival when

"squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the elderly. objective: while squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (hnscc) most commonly affects individuals in the fifth to seventh decades of life, it occasionally arises in older patients. biologic and epidemiologic factors of hnscc in elderly patients have been investigated to shed light on the process of neoplastic transformation in that population. design: the medical records of patients with new onset of hnscc presenting between 1988 and 1993 were reviewed retrospectively. setting: tertiary-care hospital-based clinic. patients: eighty-one individuals who developed hnscc of the upper aerodigestive tract after their 75th birthday constituted the study group. a control group consisting of 102 patients who developed hnscc between the ages of 40 and 70 years was also analyzed. main outcome measure: information about each individual's tobacco and ethanol exposure, family history of cancer, history of second primary cancer, treatment provided, and current disease status were derived from the medical record. the presence or absence of p53 gene mutation was tabulated for a subset of individuals in both the elderly and the middle-aged groups. results: the elderly patients had a significantly lower degree of alcohol and tobacco exposure, but a significantly higher rate of second primary cancers, especially in sites outside the upper aerodigestive tract. there was no difference in the incidence of cancer in first-degree relatives in the two groups. these findings were interpreted in light of results from our laboratory examining the incidence of p53 gene mutation in a large number of patients with hnscc. a significantly higher percentage of tumors from the younger group contained a p53 gene mutation. major surgery was an integral part of the treatment plan for most of the older patient group despite their advanced age. conclusions: these findings suggest that hnscc arising after the seventh decade of life less frequently involves a genetic change commonly found in younger patients. heavy carcinogen exposure and p53 gene mutations are present less often in elderly individuals, whereas this group appears to be more susceptible to multiple cancers. the precise biologic factors involved in neoplastic transformation in this older population await discovery. since aggressive therapy can be successfully tolerated by many elderly patients, an individualized approach to treatment is advocated.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:262-265)",p53 gene mutation;;hnscc;;squamous cell

"cost analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis in clean head and neck surgery. objective: this study was undertaken to assess the excess cost of hospitalization accrued to patients who develop postoperative wound infection following neck dissection in which the wound was not exposed to secretions from the upper aerodigestive tract. design: a retrospective cohort of patients who underwent ""clean"" neck dissection from 1976 to 1989 were evaluated. antibiotic administration (yes or no), postoperative wound infection (yes or no), and duration and cost of hospitalization were assessed. setting: all surgeries were performed in a university medical center. patients: all patients underwent neck dissection in which the procedure was clean, ie, there was no exposure to secretions from the upper aerodigestive tract. main outcome measures: patients were assessed to determine administration of antibiotics (yes or no), development of postoperative wound infection (yes or no), and duration and cost of hospitalization. results: wound infection developed in 10 (10%) of 99 patients who did not receive antibiotics. of 93 patients who received perioperative antibiotics, three (3.3%) developed wound infection. this difference was not statistically significant. the type ii (汕) error was greater than 0.2, suggesting that a significant difference may have been missed (false-negative) as a result of the small number of patients studied. the excess cost accrued to each patient who developed a postoperative wound infection was in excess of $36 000 (1992 dollars). the cost of administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to 100 patients is less than this amount. conclusion: the decision to withhold antibiotic prophylaxis should not be made in an effort to reduce hospital costs.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:269-271)",wound infection;;postoperative wound infection;;neck dissection;;antibiotic prophylaxis;;upper aerodigestive tract;;duration and cost;;excess cost;;main outcome measures;;cost analysis;;neck surgery;;hospital costs;;dollars;;perioperative antibiotics;;antibiotic administration,"cost analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis in clean head and neck surgery.;;objective: this study was undertaken to assess the excess cost of hospitalization accrued to patients who develop postoperative wound infection following neck dissection in which the wound was not exposed to secretions from the upper aerodigestive tract.;;design: a retrospective cohort of patients who underwent ""clean"" neck dissection from 1976 to 1989 were evaluated.;;antibiotic administration (yes or no), postoperative wound infection (yes or no), and duration and cost of hospitalization were assessed.;;setting: all surgeries were performed in a university medical center.;;patients: all patients underwent neck dissection in which the procedure was clean, ie, there was no exposure to secretions from the upper aerodigestive tract.;;main outcome measures: patients were assessed to determine administration of antibiotics (yes or no), development of postoperative wound infection (yes or no), and duration and cost of hospitalization.;;results: wound infection developed in 10 (10%) of 99 patients who did not receive antibiotics.;;of 93 patients who received perioperative antibiotics, three (3.3%) developed wound infection.;;this difference was not statistically significant.;;the type ii (汕) error was greater than 0.2, suggesting that a significant difference may have been missed (false-negative) as a result of the small number of patients studied.;;the excess cost accrued to each patient who developed a postoperative wound infection was in excess of $36 000 (1992 dollars).;;the cost of administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to 100 patients is less than this amount.;;conclusion: the decision to withhold antibiotic prophylaxis should not be made in an effort to reduce hospital costs.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:269-271)",significant difference;;clean head;;neck dissection;;underwent;;results;;excess cost;;assess;;cost;;design;;result;;cost analysis;;duration;;wound infection;;yes;;administration;;ie;;hospital costs;;neck surgery;;dollars;;decision;;effort;;wound;;amount;;objective;;postoperative wound infection;;main;;false-negative );;university medical center;;development;;secretions;;patient;;hospitalization;;antibiotic administration;;measures;;upper aerodigestive tract;;antibiotics;;retrospective cohort;;excess;;difference;;small number;;exposure;;study;;patients;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;antibiotic prophylaxis;;error;;conclusion;;surgeries;;type ii;;procedure
"chemotherapeutic management of head and neck malignancies with positron emission tomography. objective: antineoplastic chemotherapy in cases of nonresectable advanced malignancies of the head and neck can be very debilitating for the patient. for individual treatment planning, it is important to evaluate the early clinical effect of therapy. morphological parameters, such as the size of the tumor and its relationship to adjacent structures, which can be determined by a number of imaging procedures, hardly reflect early therapeutic effects. therefore, the metabolic activity of the tumor should be studied during antineoplastic therapy. design: positron emission tomography was performed in 12 patients with metastasizing squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx before and after the first chemotherapeutic cycle. results: the fludeoxyglucose f 18 uptake was increased in all tumors and lymph nodes. in most lesions, an obvious response to treatment was observed after the first cycle of chemotherapy. however, differences in metabolic activity and changes in metabolism occurred during therapy. the treatment response varied in different lymph nodes in the same patient. there was a linear relation between metabolic change and growth rate during therapy, with different regression functions for tumors and lymph node metastases. conclusions: positron emission tomography provides absolute and comparable quantitative data on tumor metabolism before and after chemotherapy. it is therefore a useful method for observation and possible improvement of therapeutic measures in patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:272-276)",positron emission tomography;;lymph nodes;;metabolic activity;;absolute and comparable quantitative data;;nonresectable advanced malignancies;;squamous cell carcinomas;;individual treatment planning;;early clinical effect;;different regression functions;;first chemotherapeutic cycle;;comparable quantitative data;;lymph node metastases;;early therapeutic effects;;different lymph nodes;;neck malignancies;;chemotherapeutic management,"chemotherapeutic management of head and neck malignancies with positron emission tomography.;;objective: antineoplastic chemotherapy in cases of nonresectable advanced malignancies of the head and neck can be very debilitating for the patient.;;for individual treatment planning, it is important to evaluate the early clinical effect of therapy.;;morphological parameters, such as the size of the tumor and its relationship to adjacent structures, which can be determined by a number of imaging procedures, hardly reflect early therapeutic effects.;;therefore, the metabolic activity of the tumor should be studied during antineoplastic therapy.;;design: positron emission tomography was performed in 12 patients with metastasizing squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx before and after the first chemotherapeutic cycle.;;results: the fludeoxyglucose f 18 uptake was increased in all tumors and lymph nodes.;;in most lesions, an obvious response to treatment was observed after the first cycle of chemotherapy.;;however, differences in metabolic activity and changes in metabolism occurred during therapy.;;the treatment response varied in different lymph nodes in the same patient.;;there was a linear relation between metabolic change and growth rate during therapy, with different regression functions for tumors and lymph node metastases.;;conclusions: positron emission tomography provides absolute and comparable quantitative data on tumor metabolism before and after chemotherapy.;;it is therefore a useful method for observation and possible improvement of therapeutic measures in patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:272-276)",morphological parameters;;number;;squamous cell carcinomas;;most lesions;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;design;;changes;;early clinical effect;;different regression functions;;possible improvement;;size;;useful method;;neck malignancies;;lymph nodes;;conclusions;;individual treatment;;comparable quantitative data;;nonresectable advanced malignancies;;fludeoxyglucose f;;oropharynx;;treatment;;objective;;chemotherapy;;antineoplastic therapy;;structures;;metabolism;;first chemotherapeutic cycle;;head;;positron emission tomography;;patient;;relationship;;first cycle;;hypopharynx;;differences;;therapeutic effects;;results;;chemotherapeutic management;;lymph node metastases;;larynx;;metabolic activity;;therapy;;metabolic change;;antineoplastic chemotherapy;;systemic chemotherapy;;cases;;treatment response;;procedures;;linear relation;;observation;;therapeutic measures;;neck;;uptake;;tumors;;tumor metabolism;;tumor;;patients;;growth rate;;different lymph nodes;;obvious response;;same patient
"floor of mouth carcinoma: the management of the clinically negative neck. objectives: examine the management of the clinically negative neck and evaluate the role of elective neck dissection in patients with squamous carcinoma of the floor of the mouth. design: retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients with squamous carcinoma of the floor of the mouth and no stage disease of the neck who were treated between 1973 and 1992. the mean follow-up was 6 years. patients: the cohort consisted of 129 patients. excluded from analysis were patients without evidence of disease but less than 3 years of follow-up and those with uncertain resection margins. intervention: resection of the floor of the mouth lesion with or without marginal mandibulectomy. elective lymphadenectomy was performed in 26 (23%) of the 129 patients. outcome measure: estimates were obtained of survival according to mode of therapy, classification of treatment modality, determinate cure, locoregional failure, salvage, and occult disease by clinical stage. results: occult disease was detected in 23% of the patients who underwent elective neck dissection. recurrence in the neck occurred in 36% of 103 patients who received follow-up but did not undergo elective neck dissection. the determinate survival at 3 years was 100% for patients with occult disease who underwent elective neck dissection. overall, 96% of the patients who were treated with elective neck dissection were cured;

"long-term nasal mucosal tissue expansion use in repair of large nasoseptal perforations. reperforation rates of large, surgically closed nasoseptal perforations remain unacceptably high (30% to 70%). with the advent of newer surgical techniques, including external decortication rhinoplasty and midface degloving, excellent exposure of the intranasal anatomy is afforded. the limiting factor of these approaches is the deficiency of local intranasal mucosal lining, which is used to close large septal perforations. the paucity of nasal mucosal lining results in excessive tension on the perforation closure suture line that leads to distal flap ischemia, anastomosis breakdown and, ultimately, reperforation of the septum. alternatively, using intraoral mucosal flaps of sufficient length and width to close large perforations results in significant and unacceptable donor-site morbidity. we present our technique of harvesting additional local endonasal mucosa using long-term soft-tissue expanders. long-term nasal mucosal expansion was used in the closure of large septal perforations in five patients. complications included one case of expander exposure and the morbidity of prefacial expander injections. total closure of all five septal perforations was documented at the 1-year postsurgical visit. histologic and electron-microscopic examinations of the expanded nasal floor mucosa are presented.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:327-331)",septal perforations;;large septal perforations;;nasoseptal perforations;;significant and unacceptable donor-site morbidity;;reperforation;;expanded nasal floor mucosa;;additional local endonasal mucosa;;histologic and electron-microscopic examinations;;perforation closure suture line;;local intranasal mucosal lining;;long-term nasal mucosal expansion;;nasal mucosal lining results;;large nasoseptal perforations;;large perforations results;;long-term soft-tissue expanders;;distal flap ischemia;;external decortication rhinoplasty;;1-year postsurgical visit;;nasal floor mucosa,"long-term nasal mucosal tissue expansion use in repair of large nasoseptal perforations.;;reperforation rates of large, surgically closed nasoseptal perforations remain unacceptably high (30% to 70%).;;with the advent of newer surgical techniques, including external decortication rhinoplasty and midface degloving, excellent exposure of the intranasal anatomy is afforded.;;the limiting factor of these approaches is the deficiency of local intranasal mucosal lining, which is used to close large septal perforations.;;the paucity of nasal mucosal lining results in excessive tension on the perforation closure suture line that leads to distal flap ischemia, anastomosis breakdown and, ultimately, reperforation of the septum.;;alternatively, using intraoral mucosal flaps of sufficient length and width to close large perforations results in significant and unacceptable donor-site morbidity.;;we present our technique of harvesting additional local endonasal mucosa using long-term soft-tissue expanders.;;long-term nasal mucosal expansion was used in the closure of large septal perforations in five patients.;;complications included one case of expander exposure and the morbidity of prefacial expander injections.;;total closure of all five septal perforations was documented at the 1-year postsurgical visit.;;histologic and electron-microscopic examinations of the expanded nasal floor mucosa are presented.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:327-331)",repair;;large perforations results;;midface;;results;;deficiency;;local intranasal mucosal;;intraoral mucosal flaps;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;anastomosis breakdown;;additional local endonasal mucosa;;long-term soft-tissue expanders;;sufficient length;;external decortication rhinoplasty;;total closure;;1-year postsurgical visit;;reperforation rates;;technique;;excessive tension;;nasal mucosal;;width;;nasal floor mucosa;;perforation closure suture line;;large septal perforations;;case;;long-term nasal mucosal tissue expansion use;;distal flap ischemia;;expander exposure;;histologic;;paucity;;approaches;;electron-microscopic examinations;;reperforation;;complications;;morbidity;;closure;;long-term nasal mucosal expansion;;advent;;large nasoseptal perforations;;limiting factor;;patients;;unacceptable donor-site morbidity;;intranasal anatomy;;newer surgical techniques;;prefacial expander injections;;high (;;excellent exposure;;septum;;nasoseptal perforations;;septal perforations

"antibiotic resistance. antibiotics are commonly viewed as the most important advance in the history of medicine. during the six decades that followed the introduction of sulfonamides there has been a continuous supply of new agents responsive to evolving resistance of prior pathogens and emerging new pathogens. it now appears that the microbes confronting clinicians in the 1990s pose challenges that are unprecedented in the recent past. there are examples in virtually every category: malaria, multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis, multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli, azole-resistant candida species, and metronidazole-resistant trichomonas. the two pathogens that are arguably the most important to otolaryngologists are vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the former is a nosocomially acquired pathogen that is especially prevalent in intensive care units and usually cannot be treated with antibiotics that have established merit. penicillin-resistant s pneumoniae is suddenly becoming a major problem in much of the world and its frequency in the united states is escalating at an alarming rate, especially in some geographic areas. this organism will require entirely new strategies for the empiric treatment of serious infections in which s pneumoniae is a documented or suspected pathogen. it is premature to say that traditional approaches to sinusitis and otitis need to be changed, but many suspect this will happen. one important lesson from this experience is that extensive antibiotic use and abuse has had some devastating consequences and many now believe that these are inevitable given current usage rates. the second lesson is that, although resistance seems predictable, specific

"chronic otitis media with effusion in infancy: how frequent is it? how does it develop?. objective: to study the occurrence and development of chronic otitis media with effusion in infancy. design: a retrospective birth cohort with a 2-year follow-up. infection data were gathered from medical records; background information came from questionnaires. setting: primary health care centers, hospitals, and private practices in 10 randomly selected local government districts in the two northernmost provinces of finland. subjects: a random sample of 2512 children from the cohort. main outcome measures: chronic otitis media with effusion determined as a minimum of 2 months of asymptomatic middle ear effusion revealed by tympanocentesis and specific operative findings. results: the periodic prevalence rate of chronic otitis media with effusion up to the age of 24 months was 4.4% (95% confidence interval, 3.5 to 5.3). the maximum risk was at age 16 months. the number of acute otitis media episodes among children who developed chronic otitis media with effusion was more than double that of normal healthy children before the onset of chronic inflammation and about five times as high during prolonged mucous middle ear effusion. inadequate treatment of prior acute otitis media was not the reason for the chronic inflammation, which was a direct continuation of an acute episode in only half of the cases and was otherwise preceded by a latent period of varying duration. conclusions: chronic otitis media with effusion, which may cause adverse developmental effects such as delayed language development, is a fairly common disease in infancy and is closely related to acute otitis media episodes.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:432-436)",chronic otitis media;;effusion;;acute otitis media episodes;;chronic inflammation;;tympanocentesis and specific operative findings;;prolonged mucous middle ear effusion;;selected local government districts;;primary health care centers;;prior acute otitis media;;mucous middle ear effusion;;asymptomatic middle ear effusion;;95% confidence interval;;local government districts;;specific operative findings;;retrospective birth cohort;;adverse developmental effects;;fairly common disease;;main outcome measures;;two northernmost provinces,"chronic otitis media with effusion in infancy: how frequent is it?;;how does it develop?.;;objective: to study the occurrence and development of chronic otitis media with effusion in infancy.;;design: a retrospective birth cohort with a 2-year follow-up.;;infection data were gathered from medical records;

"regional cerebral activation during auditory stimulation in patients with cochlear implants. objective: to evaluate a possible change in the regional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) in the language-related cortical areas of the brain during stimulation of a cochlear implant. methods: the rcbf was measured by single-photon emission tomography and inhalation of xenon xe 133, providing information on the regional functional level of the brain. a supplementary single-photon emission tomographic scan was also performed, using technetium tc 99m hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime as a flow marker. the rcbf was measured during rest (baseline) and during auditory stimulation by presenting white noise and running speech to the ear with the implant. patients: five deaf patients who had undergone intracochlear or extracochlear implantation surgery. results: as in subjects with normal hearing, notable activation was not found in the relevant primary auditory cortex on stimulation with white noise. two of the patients with implants had an increase in the rcbf in the relevant contralateral hemisphere on stimulation with running speech, but in the other three patients, a notable increase was not detected. this lack of increase in the rcbf on speech stimulation was consistent with the lack of speech recognition experienced by the subjects when using the implant. in one subject, the implant had a beneficial effect on speech understanding that was associated with a significant increase in the cerebral blood flow in the broca's speech area and wernicke's second speech area. conclusions: although the results are preliminary, the single-photon emission tomographic technique may be useful when evaluating the function of a cochlear implant. the method may also help select patients and/or ears for cochlear implantation. four of five patients had functional defects of auditory relevant cortical areas, suggesting that their deafness might be associated with central

"cochlear implantation in a patient after removal of an acoustic neuroma: the implications of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium on patient management. the advent of magnetic resonance imaging has allowed otologists to focus on the early removal of acoustic neuromas with the goal of hearing preservation. clearly, there are some unpredictable factors, such as placement of the tumor in the medial vs the lateral segment of the internal auditory canal and the capricious nature of the blood supply to these benign neoplasms, that make prediction of hearing preservation difficult. nonetheless, the present goal of surgery for removal of acoustic tumors has changed its focus from preservation of the facial nerve alone to preservation of the facial nerve and preservation of hearing. in a patient with an only-hearing ear and a small acoustic neuroma, there is some controversy concerning whether the tumor should be removed early, with the goal of hearing preservation, or if the patient should be allowed to progress to a considerable hearing loss in an effort to preserve natural hearing as long as possible. we report a case in which an acoustic tumor was removed from an only-hearing ear in a patient with neurofibromatosis after hearing loss had progressed in that ear but before the development of total deafness. postoperatively, the patient successfully underwent cochlear implantation. we also discuss decisions that we made during the surgical procedure, as well as the feasibility of cochlear implantation in patients with profound deafness after the excision of acoustic neuromas.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:465-468)",acoustic neuroma;;hearing preservation;;cochlear implantation;;magnetic resonance imaging;;acoustic neuromas;;facial nerve;;only-hearing ear;;acoustic tumor;;hearing loss;;internal auditory canal;;considerable hearing loss;;early removal;;patient management;;unpredictable factors;;surgical procedure;;acoustic tumors,"cochlear implantation in a patient after removal of an acoustic neuroma: the implications of magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium on patient management.;;the advent of magnetic resonance imaging has allowed otologists to focus on the early removal of acoustic neuromas with the goal of hearing preservation.;;clearly, there are some unpredictable factors, such as placement of the tumor in the medial vs the lateral segment of the internal auditory canal and the capricious nature of the blood supply to these benign neoplasms, that make prediction of hearing preservation difficult.;;nonetheless, the present goal of surgery for removal of acoustic tumors has changed its focus from preservation of the facial nerve alone to preservation of the facial nerve and preservation of hearing.;;in a patient with an only-hearing ear and a small acoustic neuroma, there is some controversy concerning whether the tumor should be removed early, with the goal of hearing preservation, or if the patient should be allowed to progress to a considerable hearing loss in an effort to preserve natural hearing as long as possible.;;we report a case in which an acoustic tumor was removed from an only-hearing ear in a patient with neurofibromatosis after hearing loss had progressed in that ear but before the development of total deafness.;;postoperatively, the patient successfully underwent cochlear implantation.;;we also discuss decisions that we made during the surgical procedure, as well as the feasibility of cochlear implantation in patients with profound deafness after the excision of acoustic neuromas.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:465-468)",unpredictable factors;;facial nerve;;implications;;neurofibromatosis;;surgical procedure;;focus;;preservation;;internal auditory;;feasibility;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;gadolinium;;acoustic tumors;;surgery;;otologists;;decisions;;benign neoplasms;;hearing preservation;;considerable hearing loss;;ear;;natural hearing;;goal;;patients;;removal;;magnetic resonance;;development;;make prediction;;progress;;medial vs;;excision;;present goal;;patient;;cochlear implantation;;total deafness;;acoustic neuroma;;only-hearing ear;;early removal;;profound deafness;;hearing preservation difficult;;hearing;;effort;;case;;patient management;;controversy;;placement;;acoustic tumor;;advent;;blood supply;;tumor;;hearing loss;;capricious nature;;facial nerve alone;;acoustic neuromas;;small acoustic neuroma;;lateral segment

"the treacher collins syndrome: a clinical, radiological, and genetic linkage study on two pedigrees. background: the treacher collins syndrome (tcs) is an autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome with variable penetrance and expression. the clinical characteristics are the result of dysmorphogenesis of the first and second embryonal branchial arch systems. the gene responsible has been located on the long arm of chromosome 5. treacher collins syndrome is rare, and in 60% of the patients the family history is negative. consequently, only a few family studies are available. this renders it difficult to make a diagnosis and to comply with the increasing demand for genetic counseling. to gain insight into the diagnosis and variation in expression and penetrance of tcs, a clinical study was started followed by gene linkage research. methods: audiological and physical tests were performed on 59 persons belonging to two families. in selected cases (n=19), vestibular and radiological examinations were also conducted. blood samples were taken from 55 persons for gene linkage studies. results: the diagnosis of tcs could be made in 13 persons after clinical examination. the radiological detection of zygomatic hypoplasia or aplasia played an important supportive role. in addition to the 13 persons with tcs mentioned above, gene linkage studies showed positive linkage to

"management of sinusitis in cystic fibrosis by endoscopic surgery and serial antimicrobial lavage: reduction in recurrence requiring surgery. objective: an effective treatment program for refractory chronic sinusitis in patients with cystic fibrosis has not been achieved. we developed a long-term management approach by combining endoscopic surgery with serial antimicrobial lavage (essal). design: in a before and after trial, results of essal in 32 patients were compared with those of conventional sinus surgery without serial antimicrobial lavage in 19 patients. at least 1 year follow-up was available in all but one patient. setting and patients: patients attending the stanford (calif) cystic fibrosis center were consecutively referred for otolaryngologic evaluation for symptoms and signs of refractory sinusitis. those subjects who were evaluated before 1990 were treated conventionally and afterward by essal. intervention: conventionally treated patients underwent one or more of the following procedures: polypectomy, ethmoidectomy, antrostomy, or caldwell-luc operation. the essal approach incorporated preoperative rhinosinuscopy and computed tomography, endoscopic surgery, a postoperative course of antral antimicrobial lavage, and monthly maintenance antimicrobial lavage via brief antral catheterization. main outcome measure: intensity and frequency of sinus surgery after

"lymphatic malformations of the head and neck: a proposal for staging. objective: to propose a staging system for patients with lymphatic malformations of the head and neck. design: retrospective chart review. patients: fifty-six patients were treated for lymphatic malformations from 1983 to 1993 at children's hospital and medical center, seattle, wash. the charts were reviewed for anatomic location of the lesion, preoperative and postoperative complications, number of procedures to control disease, long-term sequelae, and persistence of disease. lesions were characterized as being unilateral or bilateral and suprahyoid and/or infrahyoid. the five patient groups were then compared with respect to the above categories. results: preoperative complications reviewed include preoperative infection, respiratory embarassment necessitating airway intervention, and feeding difficulties. postoperative complications assessed were cranial nerve injury, wound infection, and seroma formation. long-term sequelae included malocclusion, speech delay, and cosmetic deformity. the rate of persistent disease was also assessed. a staging system was developed based on a progression of extent of disease. stage i patients (n=12) had unilateral infrahyoid disease and a 17% incidence of complications overall. stage ii patients (n=17) had unilateral suprahyoid disease and a 41% incidence of complications. stage iii patients (n=15) had unilateral suprahyoid and infrahyoid disease and a complication rate of 67%. stage iv patients (n=5) with bilateral suprahyoid disease

"the importance of maintaining the alar-facial sulcus in nasal reconstruction. the alar-facial sulcus is an important topographical region because it represents a junctional zone of three cosmetic units: the nasal base, the medial aspect of the cheek, and the upper lip. too often, the sulcus is violated by transposition flaps that have been harvested from the cheek to reconstruct defects of the nasal-alar lobule. when the sulcus is violated by surgery, it is difficult to restore a completely natural appearance. for this reason, we suggest an alternative method of reconstructing the alar lobule through the use of an interpolated flap. when defects extend into the alar-facial sulcus, reconstruction of the sulcus is necessary and should be accomplished with a separate skin flap from that used to repair the nasal component of the defect. when a single flap is used to reconstruct both lobule and sulcus, restoration of a completely natural-appearing sulcus is rarely achieved and usually involves multiple surgical procedures often facilitated by aggressive flap contouring, secondary intention healing, and z-plasty. we describe our methodology in restoring the alar-facial sulcus after nasal reconstruction.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:617-622)",alar-facial sulcus;;sulcus;;nasal reconstruction;;alar lobule;;lobule;;important topographical region;;three cosmetic units;;lobule and sulcus;;separate skin flap;;completely natural appearance;;multiple surgical procedures;;secondary intention healing;;completely natural-appearing sulcus;;medial aspect;;junctional zone;;upper lip;;cosmetic units,"the importance of maintaining the alar-facial sulcus in nasal reconstruction.;;the alar-facial sulcus is an important topographical region because it represents a junctional zone of three cosmetic units: the nasal base, the medial aspect of the cheek, and the upper lip.;;too often, the sulcus is violated by transposition flaps that have been harvested from the cheek to reconstruct defects of the nasal-alar lobule.;;when the sulcus is violated by surgery, it is difficult to restore a completely natural appearance.;;for this reason, we suggest an alternative method of reconstructing the alar lobule through the use of an interpolated flap.;;when defects extend into the alar-facial sulcus, reconstruction of the sulcus is necessary and should be accomplished with a separate skin flap from that used to repair the nasal component of the defect.;;when a single flap is used to reconstruct both lobule and sulcus, restoration of a completely natural-appearing sulcus is rarely achieved and usually involves multiple surgical procedures often facilitated by aggressive flap contouring, secondary intention healing, and z-plasty.;;we describe our methodology in restoring the alar-facial sulcus after nasal reconstruction.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:617-622)",alternative method;;lobule;;defect;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;nasal-alar lobule;;single flap;;separate skin flap;;important topographical region;;surgery;;nasal component;;nasal base;;use;;medial aspect;;multiple surgical procedures;;methodology;;alar-facial sulcus;;reconstruction;;alar lobule;;aggressive flap;;natural appearance;;transposition flaps;;flap;;importance;;upper lip;;reason;;restoration;;nasal reconstruction;;sulcus;;secondary intention healing;;natural-appearing sulcus;;cheek;;cosmetic units;;junctional zone;;restoring;;defects

"maxillary swing approach for resection of tumors in and around the nasopharynx. t efficacy of the anterolateral approach to the nasopharynx and its vicinity was evaluated. using this maxillary swing approach, we have removed tumors in and around the nasopharyngeal region in 26 patients. among them, 18 suffered from recurrent primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma after external radiotherapy, three patients had chordoma, two had schwannoma, one had adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx, and one had malignant fibrous histiocytoma. the last patient had a recurrent deep-lobe parotid gland tumor localized in the paranasopharyngeal space. the facial wounds in all 26 patients healed primarily with no evidence of necrosis of the maxilla. seven patients developed palatal fistula, five of them subsequently healed, whereas one patient required surgical closure and one had to wear a dental plate. this group of patients was followed up from 4 to 42 months (median, 15 months). among the 18 patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma, five had local recurrence, four died of other conditions, and nine of them are still alive with no evidence of disease. this gives an actuarial control of tumor in the nasopharynx of 42% at 3.5 years. in the eight patients remaining, one died of recurrent chordoma, two are alive with recurrent disease, and five are free of disease. exposure of the nasopharynx and the paranasopharyngeal space is possible using the anterolateral approach. the associated morbidity is low.

"otitis media with effusion in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, postirradiation. eighteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were subjected to eustachian tube function testing before and 6 months and 5 years after irradiation at the university hospital to investigate the chronological changes of tubal function induced by irradiation and to study the development of otitis media with effusion after irradiation. improvement of tubal function was found 5 years after irradiation in those ears without otitis media. however, in patients who had otitis media with effusion after irradiation, deterioration of tubal function was persistent, and inflammatory reaction was detected in the upper respiratory tract, including the maxillary sinus and nasopharynx. thus, the development of otitis media with effusion after irradiation in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma is attributable to both tubal and inflammatory factors. insertion of a ventilatory tube in ears can relieve tubal obstruction but can possibly aggravate the inflammatory process. therefore, it is our opinion that myringotomy plus local treatment may be preferable to insertion of a ventilatory tube in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have otitis media with effusion.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:765-768)",otitis media;;nasopharyngeal carcinoma;;tubal function;;ventilatory tube;;effusion;;eustachian tube function testing;;maxillary sinus and nasopharynx;;tubal and inflammatory factors;;myringotomy plus local treatment;;upper respiratory tract;;chronological changes;;university hospital;;eighteen patients;;tubal obstruction;;inflammatory process;;maxillary sinus;;local treatment;;inflammatory factors,"otitis media with effusion in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, postirradiation.;;eighteen patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were subjected to eustachian tube function testing before and 6 months and 5 years after irradiation at the university hospital to investigate the chronological changes of tubal function induced by irradiation and to study the development of otitis media with effusion after irradiation.;;improvement of tubal function was found 5 years after irradiation in those ears without otitis media.;;however, in patients who had otitis media with effusion after irradiation, deterioration of tubal function was persistent, and inflammatory reaction was detected in the upper respiratory tract, including the maxillary sinus and nasopharynx.;;thus, the development of otitis media with effusion after irradiation in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma is attributable to both tubal and inflammatory factors.;;insertion of a ventilatory tube in ears can relieve tubal obstruction but can possibly aggravate the inflammatory process.;;therefore, it is our opinion that myringotomy plus local treatment may be preferable to insertion of a ventilatory tube in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who have otitis media with effusion.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:765-768)",effusion;;irradiation;;years;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;insertion;;postirradiation;;chronological changes;;tubal obstruction;;ventilatory tube;;inflammatory process;;media;;eustachian tube function testing;;improvement;;university hospital;;nasopharyngeal carcinoma;;maxillary sinus;;development;;myringotomy;;otitis;;tubal function;;local treatment;;opinion;;inflammatory factors;;upper respiratory tract;;otitis media;;study;;months;;patients;;deterioration;;nasopharynx;;inflammatory reaction;;ears

"metoclopramide enhances the effect of photodynamic therapy on xenografted human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. objective: photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a promising new treatment modality for head and neck cancer that is based on the uptake of a systemically administered photosensitizer in tumor tissue and local illumination of the lesion by a high-intensity visible light source, typically a tunable argon-pumped dye laser. we developed a new photosensitizer named silicon phthalocyanine [sipc(oh) osi(ch3)2(ch2)3n(ch3)2, abbreviated as sipc iv], which yields superior pdt responses in vitro and in vivo compared with other clinically used photosensitizers. however, tumor regrowth following sipc iv〞based pdt is still a therapeutic problem. the benzamide derivatives, for example, have been shown to enhance tumor ablation when used during radiotherapy and chemotherapy. therefore, we used metoclopramide hydrochloride, a benzamide derivative, to evaluate its effects on

the intraperitoneal injection of sipc iv (1.0 mg/kg). metoclopramide hydrochloride (2 to 48 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour before and 24 and 48 hours after irradiation. results: tumors

"chromosome 11q13 amplification in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: association with poor prognosis. objective: to determine the clinical and prognostic significance of chromosome 11q13 amplification in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. design: retrospective clinical analysis. setting: university and private cancer centers. patients: fifty-six patients with pathologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma whose tumors had been assayed for the presence or absence of chromosome 11q13 amplification. measurements: the degree of dna amplification in each tumor was determined using chromosome 11q13 probes for the bcl-1 major translocation cluster, prad1/cyclin d1 (ccnd1), the fibroblast growth factor gene hst1, ems1, and glutathione-s-transferase-pi-1. the presence or absence of amplification in each patient was correlated with primary site, tumor stage, nodal status, presence or absence of distant metastasis, disease recurrence, time to recurrence, clinical outcome (disease status), and overall survival. results: amplification of chromosome 11q13 was identified in 39% (22/56) of patients. recurrent or persistent disease was identified in 82% (18/22) of cases with amplification and 50% (14/28) of nonamplified cases (p=.04). mean time to recurrence was shorter in cases with amplification (6.2 months) than those without amplification (10.1 months) (p=.01). eighteen patients (82%) with amplification and 10 patients (38%) without amplification died of disease or are alive with disease (p=.001). the mean follow-up period was 15.8 months for patients with amplification and 18.6 months for patients without amplification. overall survival was significantly diminished in patients with amplification (p=.002). amplification was not related to nodal status, distant metastases, or initial disease stage. conclusions: amplification of chromosome 11q13 loci may be an important biologic marker indicating poor prognosis, independent of

"progressive hearing loss after transverse temporal bone fracture. transverse fractures often violate the otic capsule and commonly, although not invariably, result in immediate and profound sensorineural hearing loss. the pathogenic mechanisms producing sensorineural hearing loss include direct trauma to the cochlear nerve, disruption of the membranous labyrinth, vascular compromise or hemorrhage into the inner ear, perilymphatic fistula, and endolymphatic hydrops. the last two mechanisms account for the occasional patient who develops progressive sensorineural hearing loss after the initial insult. on early posttraumatic evaluation three patients were discovered to have transverse fractures and residual auditory function. deterioration of hearing led to middle-ear exploration with closure of perilymphatic fistulas. hearing was preserved in two patients. diagnosis of posttraumatic perilymphatic fistulas requires early audiometric assessment, high-resolution computed tomographic scanning of the temporal bones to detect fracture of the otic capsule and pneumolabyrinth, and a high index of clinical suspicion.

"delayed diagnosis and fate of congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma). objective: to analyze clinical presentation, modes of detection, growth pattern, operative findings, and results of surgery in children 3 years old or older who had extensive congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma). design: survey, case series. setting: two academically affiliated medical centers: a children's hospital and an eye, ear, and throat hospital, both located in major metropolitan cities. patients: twenty-five children selected according to specified criteria. intervention: tympanomastoid surgery, ie, canal wall up and canal wall down, some with ossicular reconstructive surgery. main outcome measure: audiologic assessment (speech reception threshold) and recurrence (recidivism) of cholesteatoma. results: incidence of recidivism, 52%. hearing maintained within the range of normal to mild hearing impairment postoperatively in 91 % of the patients for whom complete data are available. conclusions: congenital cholesteatoma may grow for years without causing signs or symptoms and, having grown without early detection, can extend to involve the epitympanum and mastoid antrum, cause ossicular erosion, and even extend to the middle cranial fossa. to adequately remove a congenital cholesteatoma that has gone undetected for many years, exposure of the anterior epitympanum is often necessary and removal of both the body of the incus and the head of the malleus often is required. since congenital cholesteatoma usually develops in a child with a well-pneumatized mastoid that would create a large mastoid bowl if exteriorized, the otologic surgeon is likely to hesitate in using the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique. alternatives to the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique, which can achieve reasonably good hearing results and avoid creation of a large mastoid bowl, include planned two-stage canal wall up surgery or canal preservation with primary reconstruction and close follow-up with otomicroscopy and serial computed tomographic scans.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:903-907)","congenital cholesteatoma;;canal wall;;cholesteatoma;;large mastoid

of recidivism, 52%.;;hearing maintained within the range of normal to mild hearing impairment postoperatively in 91 % of the patients for whom complete data are available.;;conclusions: congenital cholesteatoma may grow for years without causing signs or symptoms and, having grown without early detection, can extend to involve the epitympanum and mastoid antrum, cause ossicular erosion, and even extend to the middle cranial fossa.;;to adequately remove a congenital cholesteatoma that has gone undetected for many years, exposure of the anterior epitympanum is often necessary and removal of both the body of the incus and the head of the malleus often is required.;;since congenital cholesteatoma usually develops in a child with a well-pneumatized mastoid that would create a large mastoid bowl if exteriorized, the otologic surgeon is likely to hesitate in using the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique.;;alternatives to the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique, which can achieve reasonably good hearing results and avoid creation of a large mastoid bowl, include planned two-stage canal wall up surgery or canal preservation with primary reconstruction and close

"internal carotid artery resection for invasion of malignant tumors. background: to study the preoperative investigation and outcome of patients who underwent resection of the internal carotid artery for malignant disease. a retrospective analysis using a chart review of these patients was performed, and the results were analyzed. all patients were treated by one of us (u.k.n.) at the university of california〞davis medical center, sacramento. a population of 18 patients who underwent a transcervical, transpetrosal, or petrocavernous resection of the internal carotid artery from 1976 to 1993 was studied. preoperative study consisted of four-vessel arteriography, balloon test occlusion, electroencephalographic intraoperative monitoring, and, after 1990, single-photon emission computed tomographic scanning. disease-free interval and neurologic complications were assessed. results: two patients were alive and well without disease at 6 and 9 months postoperatively. one patient was alive and well at 12 months, and three have survived more than 2 years without recurrent tumor. eleven patients died within 1 year of surgery (three postoperatively, six of recurrent disease, and two of unknown causes). one patient died of disease at 14 months. conclusions: internal carotid artery invasion by malignancy portends a poor prognosis. carotid artery resection can provide reasonable palliation. early results of skull-base surgery on patients with intrapetrous and petrocavernous carotid artery involvement are encouraging. balloon test occlusion and single-photon emission computed tomographic scanning provide a valuable assessment of contralateral cerebral blood flow.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:1029-1033)",internal carotid artery;;carotid artery resection;;balloon test occlusion;;single-photon emission;;tomographic scanning;;internal carotid artery resection;;preoperative investigation and outcome;;contralateral cerebral blood flow;;petrocavernous carotid artery involvement;;internal carotid artery invasion;;electroencephalographic intraoperative monitoring;;preoperative investigation;;malignant tumors;;malignant disease;;poor prognosis;;retrospective analysis,"internal carotid artery resection for invasion of malignant tumors.;;background: to study the preoperative investigation and outcome of patients who underwent resection of the internal carotid artery for malignant disease.;;a retrospective analysis using a chart review of these patients was performed, and the results were analyzed.;;all patients were treated by one of us (u.k.n.;;) at the university of california〞davis medical center, sacramento.;;a population of 18 patients who underwent a transcervical, transpetrosal, or petrocavernous resection of the internal carotid artery from 1976 to 1993 was studied.;;preoperative study consisted of four-vessel arteriography, balloon test occlusion, electroencephalographic intraoperative monitoring, and, after 1990, single-photon emission computed tomographic scanning.;;disease-free interval and neurologic complications were assessed.;;results: two patients were alive and well without disease at 6 and 9 months postoperatively.;;one patient was alive and well at 12 months, and three have survived more than 2 years without recurrent tumor.;;eleven patients died within 1 year of surgery (three postoperatively, six of recurrent disease, and two of unknown causes).;;one patient died of disease at 14 months.;;conclusions: internal carotid artery invasion by malignancy portends a poor prognosis.;;carotid artery resection can provide reasonable palliation.;;early results of skull-base surgery on patients with intrapetrous and petrocavernous carotid artery involvement are encouraging.;;balloon test occlusion and single-photon emission computed tomographic scanning provide a valuable assessment of contralateral cerebral blood flow.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1995;121:1029-1033)",poor prognosis;;malignancy portends;;internal carotid artery;;tomographic scanning provide;;underwent;;preoperative study;;results;;preoperative investigation;;years;;transpetrosal;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;contralateral cerebral blood flow;;balloon test occlusion;;year;;skull-base surgery;;surgery;;underwent resection;;internal carotid artery resection;;four-vessel arteriography;;conclusions;;unknown causes;;petrocavernous resection;;malignant tumors;;valuable assessment;;retrospective analysis;;single-photon emission;;patient;;recurrent disease;;electroencephalographic intraoperative monitoring;;artery resection;;disease-free interval;;background;;california〞davis medical center;;invasion;;population;;malignant disease;;internal carotid artery invasion;;recurrent tumor;;study;;months;;disease;;petrocavernous carotid artery involvement;;patients;;reasonable palliation;;tomographic scanning;;chart review;;outcome;;neurologic complications;;university

"vascular anatomy of the nose and the external rhinoplasty approach. objective: to characterize the venous, lymphatic, and arterial blood supply of the nose and determine the effect of the external rhinoplasty approach on this vasculature. we hypothesized that dissection in the areolar tissue plane below the musculoaponeurotic layer of the nose will preserve the nasal vasculature and minimize postoperative nasal tip edema. design: the study included preoperative and postoperative clinical evaluation, cadaver dissection, and histologic examination. in the clinical section, lymphoscintigraphy was performed before and after rhinoplasty using the endonasal (transnostril) or external (open) approach. additionally, nasal tip edema was subjectively quantified at specified intervals after surgery. in the cadaver dissection section, 15 fresh cadavers were dissected to identify the venous and arterial vasculature. in the histology section, fresh nasal tissue was examined by light microscopy to verify the anatomy of arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. setting: subjects for the clinical section of the study were volunteers undergoing primary rhinoplasty surgery at the university of illinois college of medicine at chicago. patients: lymphoscintigraphy was performed on nine patients who underwent rhinoplasty surgery. seven of these patients underwent postoperative lymphoscintigraphy. interventions: the rhinoplasty procedures included three different methods of exposure of the nasal structures. two patients underwent an endonasal (transnostril) nondelivery approach using a transcartilaginous incision. five patients underwent the external approach with three receiving dissection in the areolar tissue plane below the musculoaponeurotic layer (preserving major nasal vasculature) and two undergoing dissection above the musculoaponeurotic layer (disrupting nasal vasculature). main outcome measures: in the clinical section of the study, the outcome measures were tracer flow as seen on lymphoscintigraphy and tip edema scores subjectively quantitated on a scale from 1 (none) to 4 (maximal). results: clinical section: lymphoscintigraphy revealed flow of tracer along the lateral aspect of the nose (cephalic to lateral crura) to the preparotid lymph nodes. postoperative scans revealed preservation of flow of tracer with the endonasal (transnostril) approach and the external approach with submusculoaponeurotic areolar tissue plane dissection. there was loss of normal flow of tracer with the external approach using dissection that disrupted the musculoaponeurotic layer with supratip debulking. the nasal tip edema scores for the transnostril and external approach using areolar plane dissection were significantly lower than the external approach with disruption of the musculoaponeurotic layer. cadaver dissection section: other than the lateral nasal veins, the major arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels ran superficial to the musculoaponeurotic layer of the nose. the lateral and dorsal nasal and the columellar arteries comprise an alar arcade that provides the major blood supply to the flap elevated in the external rhinoplasty approach. histologic section: light microscopy of plastic resin sections verified the lymphoscintigraphic and cadaver dissection findings. the lymphatic vessels were located primarily in the reticular dermis above the muscle layer. conclusions: the major arterial, venous, and lymphatic vasculature courses in or above the musculoaponeurotic layer of the nose. in the external

"nasal reconstruction using an osteoconductive collagen gel matrix. background: congenital malformations, granulomatous diseases, and trauma can all cause destruction of the nasal structural framework, resulting in functional nasal obstruction and altered facial cosmesis. current methods of nasal reconstruction include cartilaginous and bony grafts, silastic implants, and homograft onlay materials. however, these techniques have significant functional and cosmetic drawbacks and are not risk free. native, isotonic, neutral-ph, space-filling type i collagen gels have been shown to mediate total repair of critical-size calvarial defects in a rat model. these bioengineered collagen grafts provide a framework for rapid intramembranous ossification and osteoconduction of bone from the perimeter of a defect, resulting in total bony coverage. objective: to evaluate a novel approach to nasal reconstruction using a major defect of the bony nasal dorsum with a type i collagen gel matrix. design: sixteen retired male breeder sprague-dawley rats were divided into control and experimental groups. the nasal bones were exposed through a dorsal incision and completely removed with a bone-cutting drill to the level of the mucosal membranes of the nasal vestibule. defects in the experimental animals were then implanted with 200 米g of type i collagen gel, with control animals receiving no inlay. after 6 weeks, the animals were examined with three-dimensional computed tomograpy before necropsy, at which time the defects were photographed, measured by planimetry, and sectioned for histologic analysis. results: experimental defects were observed to manifest 100% surface area healing with a thin layer of bone using a type i collagen gel osteoconductive implant for nasal reconstruction. conversely, control animals showed only a 5.7% (㊣3.7% sd) healing by area. histologic sections of the collagen gel implant revealed restoration of the anatomy with a thin plate of immature bone spanning the defect in continuity with the cartilage of the nasal septum and with apparent preservation of maxillonasalis suture lines. conclusions: native, isotonic, neutral-ph,

"the long-term effects of open cosmetic septorhinoplasty on nasal air flow. objective: to determine if elective cosmetic septorhinoplasty impacts on nasal air flow resistance over the long-term. design: case series. mean postoperative follow-up period was 41.5 months (range, 16 to 77 months). patients: a consecutive sample of 200 patients having undergone cosmetic open septorhinoplasty by one of us (p.a.a.) before july 1992 were contacted by telephone; 50 agreed to participate, and 27 actually participated in the study. interventions: open cosmetic septorhinoplasty performed by one of us (p.a.a.). main outcome measures: comparison of preoperative and postoperative nasal resistance values by head-out body displacement plethysmography; correlation of preoperative and postoperative nasal valve anatomy with nasal resistance values; and correlation of postoperative nasal resistance values with subjective evaluation of nasal air flow as reported on a 10-point analogue scale. results: of the 27 patients, 10 had normal preoperative nasal resistance values and 17 had elevated resistance values. preoperative normal group: four of the 10 patients' mean resistance values exceeded normal limits postoperatively. one of these four patients reported subjective nasal obstruction. preoperative abnormal group: of the 17 patients, surgery resulted in normal resistance values postoperatively in six, decreased but still above normal resistance values in eight, and no decrease in postoperative resistance values in three. conclusions: (1) patients with normal nasal resistance values may suffer long-term, asymptomatic increase in nasal resistance values after cosmetic open septorhinoplasty, often with no quantifiable change at the nasal valve. (2) patients with elevated nasal resistance measurements generally improve with open septorhinoplasty. patients with isolated septal deformities improve with septoplasty. patients with upper lateral cartilage collapse improve with spreader grafts. the lasting objective improvement on the nasal valve using spreader grafts is reported herein for the first time. (3) subjective estimations of nasal patency do not correlate well with objective measures of patency, namely nasal resistance measurements. (4) cosmetic septorhinoplasty can alter nasal patency. continued care must be exercised when manipulating the nasal framework for cosmetic purposes, as slight changes to the nasal valve may result in significant alterations in nasal air flow resistance.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:41-45)",resistance values;;nasal resistance values;;nasal air flow;;cosmetic septorhinoplasty;;nasal valve;;open septorhinoplasty;;nasal air flow resistance;;postoperative nasal resistance values;;open cosmetic septorhinoplasty;;cosmetic open septorhinoplasty;;nasal resistance measurements;;normal resistance values;;nasal patency;;spreader grafts;;normal preoperative nasal resistance values;;elective cosmetic septorhinoplasty impacts,"the long-term effects of open cosmetic septorhinoplasty on nasal air flow.;;objective: to determine if elective cosmetic septorhinoplasty impacts on nasal air flow resistance over the long-term.;;design: case series.;;mean postoperative follow-up period was 41.5 months (range, 16 to 77 months).;;patients: a consecutive sample of 200 patients having undergone cosmetic open septorhinoplasty by one of us (p.a.a.;;) before july 1992 were contacted by telephone; 50 agreed to participate, and 27 actually participated in the study.;;interventions: open cosmetic septorhinoplasty performed by one of us (p.a.a.).;;main outcome measures: comparison of preoperative and postoperative nasal resistance values by head-out body displacement plethysmography; correlation of preoperative and postoperative nasal valve anatomy with nasal resistance values; and correlation of postoperative nasal resistance values with subjective evaluation of nasal air flow as reported on a 10-point analogue scale.;;results: of the 27 patients, 10 had normal preoperative nasal resistance values and 17 had elevated resistance values.;;preoperative normal group: four of the 10 patients' mean resistance values exceeded normal limits postoperatively.;;one of these four patients reported subjective nasal obstruction.;;preoperative abnormal group: of the 17 patients, surgery resulted in normal resistance values postoperatively in six, decreased but still above normal resistance values in eight, and no decrease in postoperative resistance values in three.;;conclusions: (1) patients with normal nasal resistance values may suffer long-term, asymptomatic increase in nasal resistance values after cosmetic open septorhinoplasty, often with no quantifiable change at the nasal valve.;;(2) patients with elevated nasal resistance measurements generally improve with open septorhinoplasty.;;patients with isolated septal deformities improve with septoplasty.;;patients with upper lateral cartilage collapse improve with spreader grafts.;;the lasting objective improvement on the nasal valve using spreader grafts is reported herein for the first time.;;(3) subjective estimations of nasal patency do not correlate well with objective measures of patency, namely nasal resistance measurements.;;(4) cosmetic septorhinoplasty can alter nasal patency.;;continued care must be exercised when manipulating the nasal framework for cosmetic purposes, as slight changes to the nasal valve may result in significant alterations in nasal air flow resistance.;;(arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1996;122:41-45)",herein;;nasal patency;;interventions;;first time;;telephone;;nasal resistance measurements;;head-out body displacement plethysmography;;( arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;design;;patency;;consecutive sample;;open septorhinoplasty;;correlation;;surgery;;10-point analogue scale;;quantifiable change;;conclusions;;upper lateral cartilage collapse;;nasal resistance values;;range;;nasal valve;;cosmetic open septorhinoplasty;;mean resistance values;;preoperative normal group;;nasal air flow;;resistance values;;objective;;subjective evaluation;;main;;nasal framework;;asymptomatic increase;;preoperative abnormal group;;long-term effects;;mean postoperative follow-up period;;slight changes;;spreader grafts;;normal limits;;normal nasal resistance values;;postoperative nasal valve anatomy;;measures;;results;;septoplasty;;nasal air flow resistance;;case series;;normal preoperative nasal resistance values;;significant alterations;;lasting objective improvement;;objective measures;;normal resistance values;;care;;subjective nasal obstruction;;comparison;;elevated nasal resistance measurements;;postoperative resistance values;;postoperative nasal resistance values;;cosmetic septorhinoplasty;;subjective estimations;;study;;months;;isolated septal deformities;;undergone cosmetic open septorhinoplasty;;patients;;elective cosmetic septorhinoplasty impacts;;open cosmetic septorhinoplasty;;decrease;;cosmetic purposes;;p.a.a.

"cd4+ lymphocytes are increased in the sinus mucosa of children with chronic sinusitis. objective: to quantitate lymphocyte subtypes in sinus tissues harvested from children with chronic sinusitis and coexisting asthma, allergies, and cystic fibrosis during functional endoscopic sinus surgery and compare them with those in normal adult sphenoid sinus mucosa. design: immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens with monoclonal antibodies against cd4 and cd8 surface antigens. setting: tertiary medical center. patients: thirty-two children who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis refractory to medical treatment (median age, 8 years; range, 2-13 years) were divided into 3 groups: 10 with asthma, 15 without asthma, and 7 with cystic fibrosis. sphenoid sinus mucosa obtained from 10 adults (median age, 70 years) undergoing transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was used as control tissue. main outcome measures: numbers of cd4 and cd8+ cells in the lamina propria and epithelium of surgical specimens. results: significantly more cd4+ cells were in the sinus mucosa of patients with chronic sinusitis than in the normal sinus mucosa (p<.01), but there was no significant difference in the number of cd8+ cells (p=.4). patients with chronic sinusitis with asthma, without asthma, and with cystic fibrosis all had increased numbers of cd4+ cells compared with sphenoid mucosa, with the difference reaching statistical significance only in the subgroup with chronic sinusitis without asthma (p<.001). the numbers of cd4+ cells were higher in patients with chronic sinusitis than in the sphenoid mucosa irrespective of allergic status. significantly more cd4+ than cd8+ cells were in tissues from the patients with chronic sinusitis irrespective of concomitant diseases or allergic status. cd4+ and cd8+ cells were more numerous in the apical portion of the submucosa (immediately beneath the epithelium) than in the basal portion both in patients with chronic sinusitis and in normal sphenoid tissue. conclusions: children with chronic sinusitis have predominance of cd4+ cells in the sinus mucosa as compared with normal sphenoid tissue. this contrasts with published results in adults with chronic sinusitis, in whom cd8+ cells predominate in nasal polyps and the submucosa, possibly reflecting a difference in the immunologic response of children and adults.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1071-1076",chronic sinusitis;;sinus mucosa;;cystic fibrosis;;functional endoscopic sinus surgery;;sphenoid sinus mucosa;;normal sphenoid tissue;;surgical specimens;;allergic status;;median age;;sphenoid mucosa;;normal adult sphenoid sinus mucosa;;concomitant diseases or allergic status;;lamina propria and epithelium;;cd8 surface antigens;;main outcome measures;;normal sinus mucosa;;sinus tissues,"cd4+ lymphocytes are increased in the sinus mucosa of children with chronic sinusitis.;;objective: to quantitate lymphocyte subtypes in sinus tissues harvested from children with chronic sinusitis and coexisting asthma, allergies, and cystic fibrosis during functional endoscopic sinus surgery and compare them with those in normal adult sphenoid sinus mucosa.;;design: immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens with monoclonal antibodies against cd4 and cd8 surface antigens.;;setting: tertiary medical center.;;patients: thirty-two children who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis refractory to medical treatment (median age, 8 years;

"anthropometric analysis of the female latino nose: revised aesthetic concepts and their surgical implications. objective: to determine whether the present aesthetic concepts set forth for rhinoplasty in white patients can be applied to the ethnic variations seen in latino women and, if not, to develop a reproducible means of analysis to serve as a guide for surgical correction. design: cohort analytic study; criterion standard analysis of nasal aesthetics. participants: ninety-seven latino women and 40 white women. interventions: patients were separated according to geographic area of origin, either the caribbean, central america, or south america. anthropometric measurements were obtained and nasal indexes were calculated. results were compared with previously reported data for african americans and whites. all patients underwent complete nasal photographic analysis. results: caribbean subjects showed the greatest divergences from whites and resembled african-american anthropometric norms, whereas central and south american subjects more closely resembled white norms. two new aesthetic concepts were developed, the dorsal nasal breakpoint and the horizontal nasal axis, which have implications for aesthetic rhinoplasty. the breakpoint is a pivotal point along the nasal dorsum, structurally determined, which was found at different locations in all the groups studied. caribbean subjects had breakpoints approximately halfway down the dorsum. central and south americans had breakpoints about two thirds of the way down the dorsum, and whites had breakpoints three fourths of the way down the dorsum. the horizontal rotation axis is present along a plane that connects the top of the ala with the tip. rotation of the tip about this axis affects both the characteristics of the dorsal breakpoint and the final appearance of the nose. conclusions: in general, latino noses can be anthropometrically categorized as mesorrhine. when the geographically derived groups were examined individually, the latino nose ranged from subplatyrrhine to paraleptorrhine. surgical correction should be individualized, as each group requires correction of different nasal features. the dorsal breakpoint and the horizontal axis plane can act as nasal profile guides for surgical modifications that would achieve the current concept of the aesthetic nose.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1079-1086.",aesthetic concepts;;latino nose;;south america;;breakpoint;;latino women;;surgical correction;;caribbean subjects;;dorsal breakpoint;;breakpoints;;dorsum;;caribbean;;central and south american subjects;;african americans and whites;;two new aesthetic concepts;;central and south americans;;complete nasal photographic analysis;;female latino nose,"anthropometric analysis of the female latino nose: revised aesthetic concepts and their surgical implications.;;objective: to determine whether the present aesthetic concepts set forth for rhinoplasty in white patients can be applied to the ethnic variations seen in latino women and, if not, to develop a reproducible means of analysis to serve as a guide for surgical correction.;;design: cohort analytic study;

"stapes fixation associated with symphalangia. we describe a 10-year-old boy and his 9-year-old sister, both of whom had bilateral hearing loss associated with ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal joints (symphalangia). they had no other abnormal findings except hearing loss and ankylosis of the joints of some fingers and toes on systemic examination. the cause of conductive hearing loss in both cases was bony fusion between the stapes and the bone of the oval window niche. there were no other anatomical abnormalities in the middle or the external ear. the patients' hearing improved markedly after stapes surgery. histopathologic examination of the stapes revealed an abnormal zone of ossification near the anterior annular ligament and calcification in the annular ligament, which seemed to be the cause of the stapes fixation.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1124-1128",hearing loss;;stapes fixation;;annular ligament;;stapes;;symphalangia;;proximal interphalangeal joints;;bilateral hearing loss;;fingers and toes;;oval window niche;;conductive hearing loss;;anterior annular ligament;;10-year-old boy;;9-year-old sister;;abnormal zone;;systemic examination;;bony fusion,"stapes fixation associated with symphalangia.;;we describe a 10-year-old boy and his 9-year-old sister, both of whom had bilateral hearing loss associated with ankylosis of the proximal interphalangeal joints (symphalangia).;;they had no other abnormal findings except hearing loss and ankylosis of the joints of some fingers and toes on systemic examination.;;the cause of conductive hearing loss in both cases was bony fusion between the stapes and the bone of the oval window niche.;;there were no other anatomical abnormalities in the middle or the external ear.;;the patients' hearing improved markedly after stapes surgery.;;histopathologic examination of the stapes revealed an abnormal zone of ossification near the anterior annular ligament and calcification in the annular ligament, which seemed to be the cause of the stapes fixation.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1996;122:1124-1128",joints;;ankylosis;;hearing;;middle;;abnormal zone;;proximal interphalangeal joints;;calcification;;fingers;;10-year-old boy;;symphalangia;;other anatomical abnormalities;;cause;;bilateral hearing loss;;systemic examination;;bony fusion;;oval window niche;;cases;;stapes;;external ear;;annular ligament;;other abnormal findings;;conductive hearing loss;;anterior annular ligament;;stapes fixation.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;hearing loss;;patients;;histopathologic examination;;9-year-old sister;;ossification;;stapes fixation;;bone

"the liposhaver in facial plastic surgery: a multi-institutional experience. objective: to report a multi-institutional clinical experience with the liposhaver in facial plastic surgery. design: nonrandomized, nonblinded, multiinstitutional evaluation of the liposhaver in a clinical setting in patients presenting for cosmetic facial liposuction. interventions: cosmetic facial surgery with the liposhaver was performed in 19 patients (21 procedures) who underwent submental lipectomy, facelift with defatting beneath the facelift flap, and/or correction of deep nasolabial folds. standardized preoperative and postoperative photographs were obtained. fat obtained from the abdomen of 1 patient was also studied histologically. this fat was excised sharply and was then liposhaved at varying oscillation speeds. outcome measures: subjective evaluation by the operating surgeons. results: the liposhaver was used successfully in all cases. the fat was cleanly shaved and the contour results were even, without dimpling or asymmetry. operative time was comparable to that for conventional liposuction. preferred cannula sizes and settings were determined. there were no cases of facial nerve injury, no evidence of increased bleeding intraoperatively, and no hematomas in the immediate postoperative period. one patient developed a small hematoma on postoperative day 5 that was effectively treated with needle aspiration and a pressure dressing. histologic evaluation of liposhaved abdominal fat showed normal fat cells and well-preserved architecture. conclusions: the liposhaver offers a

features in children who have undergone augmentation procedures for laryngotracheal stenosis. design: follow-up survey assessment. setting: academic pediatric referral center. patients or other participants: the families of 50 patients were contacted by mail, and completed home questionnaires. of these 50 patients, 33 agreed to participate in a comprehensive hospital-based voice assessment, and 28 of these underwent fiberoptic endoscopy. interventions: hospital-based evaluation and parental questionnaire. main outcome measures: (1) perceptual voice assessment from taped samples by using the vocal profile analysis protocol performed by 3 speech and language therapists, (2) fiberoptic laryngeal endoscopy assessment performed by 3 otolaryngologists, and (3) parental assessment of voice by questionnaire. the conditions of the patients were categorized by etiology, the degree of stenosis, coexisting laryngeal lesions, and the type of surgical procedure that was done based on a review of medical records. results: eight of 33 patients were judged perceptually by using an amended version of the vocal profile analysis scheme to have ""normal"" voices. in the remaining 25 patients, abnormalities were demonstrated in the parameters, including harshness (52%), whisper (36%), ventricular band phonation (21%), continuity (27%), mean pitch (27%), and falsetto voice (12%). by using

"the role of immunosuppression in the long-term survival of tracheal allografts. objectives: to assess the functional aspects of vascularized tracheal allograft transplant models and the longterm fate of these allografts. to examine the effects of cyclosporin a (csa), 10 mg/kg per day, on the long-term survival of vascularized tracheal allografts and the presence and significance of host immune tolerance after cessation of immunosuppression. design: in a rabbit model, tracheal allografts were orthotopically transplanted after an initial period of heterotopic fascia revascularization. a full-thickness skin allograft from the same donor was used as an external monitor of the rejection process. treatment with csa was discontinued (group 2) or given intermittently (group 3) after an initial course of continuous csa administration varying from 2 to 10 weeks. the first group received a continuous regimen of csa for 10 weeks. main outcome measures: tracheal and skin allograft deterioration, microcirculation of tracheal transplant, mucociliary clearance, and histopathologic examination. results: tracheal allografts under continuous immunosuppression with csa, 10 mg/kg per day, showed no rejection and remained functional with preservation of mucociliary activity. after an initial course of csa to achieve solid tracheal union, subsequent cessation and intermittent pulsing of the immunosuppressant were insufficient in maintaining indefinite graft survival. chronic allograft rejection with simultaneous endothelial graft repopulation could be induced by intermittent pulsing of csa, which led to prolonged allograft survival in some group 3 animals. conclusion: continuous immunosuppression is necessary to preserve an optimal morphological and

"clinical characteristics and genotype analysis of patients with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis requiring surgery. objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics and genotypes of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and nasal polyposis who require surgery. design: cross-sectional analysis of a large patient database. setting: data obtained from the national cf patient registry of the cystic fibrosis foundation, bethesda, md. patients: clinical and genotype data on 20 198 patients with cf who were registered in 1992 and 1993 were analyzed. the study group (n=815) consisted of patients with cf who had undergone surgical procedures for the treatment of nasal polyposis. the comparison group (n=19 383) comprised the remainder of the patients in the database. results: statistical analysis revealed that patients with cf and nasal polyposis who required surgery had better pulmonary function (higher percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity), better nutritional status, a higher rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, more office visits, more hospitalizations, and a higher rate of acute exacerbations per year (p<.001 for each) than did the comparison group. among the patients who had mutation analysis performed, patients with nasal polyposis who required surgery were significantly associated with 2 specific genotypes: the 忖-f508/忖-f508 (57.5% vs 49.9%, p=.01) and the 忖-f508/g551d (12% vs 8%, p=.05) genotypes. conclusions: patients with cf and nasal polyposis who require surgery may constitute a clinical subgroup within the spectrum of the disease. these patients appear to have slightly better pulmonary function and nutritional status; yet, they seem to have a higher degree of health care utilization. the higher rate of p aeruginosa respiratory infection in this patient group suggests an association with the presence of nasal polyposis. genotype analysis showed a higher prevalence of the 忖-f508/忖-f508 and the 忖-f508/g551d genotypes in this patient group.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1209-1213",nasal polyposis;;cystic fibrosis;;higher rate;;better pulmonary function;;genotype analysis;;clinical characteristics;;patient group;;pulmonary function;;comparison group;;nutritional status;;忖-f508 g551d;;忖-f508 忖-f508;;higher percent-predicted forced expiratory volume;;nasal polyposis requiring surgery;;national cystic fibrosis patient registry;;slightly better pulmonary function,"clinical characteristics and genotype analysis of patients with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis requiring surgery.;;objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics and genotypes of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and nasal polyposis who require surgery.;;design: cross-sectional analysis of a large patient database.;;setting: data obtained from the national cf patient registry of the cystic fibrosis foundation, bethesda, md.;;patients: clinical and genotype data on 20 198 patients with cf who were registered in 1992 and 1993 were analyzed.;;the study group (n=815) consisted of patients with cf who had undergone surgical procedures for the treatment of nasal polyposis.;;the comparison group (n=19 383) comprised the remainder of the patients in the database.;;results: statistical analysis revealed that patients with cf and nasal polyposis who required surgery had better pulmonary function (higher percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity), better nutritional status, a higher rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, more office visits, more hospitalizations, and a higher rate of acute exacerbations per year (p<.001 for each) than did the comparison group.;;among the patients who had mutation analysis performed, patients with nasal polyposis who required surgery were significantly associated with 2 specific genotypes: the 忖-f508/忖-f508 (57.5% vs 49.9%, p=.01) and the 忖-f508/g551d (12% vs 8%, p=.05) genotypes.;;conclusions: patients with cf and nasal polyposis who require surgery may constitute a clinical subgroup within the spectrum of the disease.;;these patients appear to have slightly better pulmonary function and nutritional status;

"age-related differences in cochlear microcirculation and auditory brain stem response. objective: to examine possible age-related differences in auditory sensitivity and cochlear vascular properties. design: this study is designed to provide information regarding cochlear function using physiological and audiological measures. each animal underwent intravital microscopic evaluation of red blood cell velocity, vessel diameter, and vascular permeability in the second turn of the cochlear lateral wall. auditory brain stem responses were used to determine hearing sensitivity. subjects: four age ranges of male fischer rats were studied: young, 2 to 4 months (n=9); mid-young, 9 to 11 months (n=8); mid-old, 18 to 20 months (n=6); and old, 30 to 34 months (n=10). results: auditory brain stem response testing showed an age-related decrease in auditory sensitivity. intravital microscopic analysis showed age-related statistically significant decreases in red blood cell velocity and increased vascular permeability with a trend for reduced capillary diameters. conclusions: the process of aging is associated with many biochemical and physiological changes that include decrease in cellular water concentration, ionic changes, and decreased elasticity of cellular membranes. one contributing factor to this process may be altered vascular characteristics, such as reduced flow and vascular plasticity, as well as increased vascular permeability. these age-related changes may result in reductions in oxygen and nutrient delivery, and also waste elimination. our results suggest that progressive age-associated vascular compromise may be a contributing factor in presbycusis.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1221-1226",auditory brain stem response;;vascular permeability;;red blood cell velocity;;increased vascular permeability;;age-related differences;;auditory sensitivity;;contributing factor;;auditory brain stem response testing;;auditory brain stem responses;;age-related statistically significant decreases;;progressive age-associated vascular compromise;;physiological and audiological measures;;biochemical and physiological changes;;cochlear vascular properties;;possible age-related differences;;male fischer rats;;reduced capillary diameters;;one contributing factor;;cellular water concentration,"age-related differences in cochlear microcirculation and auditory brain stem response.;;objective: to examine possible age-related differences in auditory sensitivity and cochlear vascular properties.;;design: this study is designed to provide information regarding cochlear function using physiological and audiological measures.;;each animal underwent intravital microscopic evaluation of red blood cell velocity, vessel diameter, and vascular permeability in the second turn of the cochlear lateral wall.;;auditory brain stem responses were used to determine hearing sensitivity.;;subjects: four age ranges of male fischer rats were studied: young, 2 to 4 months (n=9);

"neuro-otological findings after radiosurgery for acoustic neurinomas. objective: to evaluate the neuro-otological complications in patients after radiosurgery for acoustic neurinomas. design: inception cohort, retrospective study. setting: university hospital. patients: a consecutive sample of 46 patients with acoustic neurinomas who underwent unilateral gamma knife radiosurgery at the university of tokyo, japan, between june 1990 and june 1994 were followed up by otolaryngologists for more than 3 months. intervention: gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery. main outcome measures: neuro-otological examinations including pure tone audiometry, auditory brain stem response, and caloric test. results: tumor growth occurred in 2 patients (4.3%). seven (18%) of the 38 patients with preserved hearing of any extent became deaf within 1 year. in cases of gradual hearing loss, the average deterioration rate was approximately 8 db per year. abnormalities of auditory brain stem

"the early history of the neurofibromatoses: evolution of the concept of neurofibromatosis type 2. although neurofibromatosis (nf) became widely recognized as a pathologic entity in the late 19th century, only relatively recently has a clear distinction been made between its generalized form and the central variety. the latter form is typified by bilateral acoustic neuromas (ans), which may be accompanied by other intracranial tumors, in particular, meningiomas. up until almost the current era, confusion regarding the protean manifestations of the 2 types of nf existed in the minds of clinicians and in the literature. in 1987, a consensus panel of the national institutes of health differentiated the clinical manifestations associated with classic von recklinghausen syndrome from those of the predominantly intracranial subtype and they were subsequently deemed nf type 1 (nf-1) and nf type 2 (nf-2), respectively. during the last few years, the genetic flaws that underlie these 2 syndromes have been elucidated, revealing that their origins lie in defects on separate chromosomes. the early literature on the subject included repeated descriptions of patients with manifestations typical of nf-2. the investigators, however, considered the intracranial lesions to be merely 1 facet of the generalized form of the disease. a few prescient individuals, however, demonstrated an appreciation for the distinguishing characteristics between these superficially similar, yet quite different, syndromes. the goals of this article are to trace the evolution of the concept of nf-2 as a distinct clinical entity from nf-1 and to assess the early awareness of and attitudes toward bilateral ans, familial ans, and ans associated with other intracranial tumors.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1240-1249",ans;;nf type;;nf-2;;classic von recklinghausen syndrome;;almost the current era;;late 19th century;;bilateral acoustic neuromas;;predominantly intracranial subtype;;merely 1 facet;;distinct clinical entity;;nf-1;;early history;;clear distinction;;pathologic entity,"the early history of the neurofibromatoses: evolution of the concept of neurofibromatosis type 2. although neurofibromatosis (nf) became widely recognized as a pathologic entity in the late 19th century, only relatively recently has a clear distinction been made between its generalized form and the central variety.;;the latter form is typified by bilateral acoustic neuromas (ans), which may be accompanied by other intracranial tumors, in particular, meningiomas.;;up until almost the current era, confusion regarding the protean manifestations of the 2 types of nf existed in the minds of clinicians and in the literature.;;in 1987, a consensus panel of the national institutes of health differentiated the clinical manifestations associated with classic von recklinghausen syndrome from those of the predominantly intracranial subtype and they were subsequently deemed nf type 1 (nf-1) and nf type 2 (nf-2), respectively.;;during the last few years, the genetic flaws that underlie these 2 syndromes have been elucidated, revealing that their origins lie in defects on separate chromosomes.;;the early literature on the subject included repeated descriptions of patients with manifestations typical of nf-2.;;the investigators, however, considered the intracranial lesions to be merely 1 facet of the generalized form of the disease.;;a few prescient individuals, however, demonstrated an appreciation for the distinguishing characteristics between these superficially similar, yet quite different, syndromes.;;the goals of this article are to trace the evolution of the concept of nf-2 as a distinct clinical entity from nf-1 and to assess the early awareness of and attitudes toward bilateral ans, familial ans, and ans associated with other intracranial tumors.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1996;122:1240-1249",concept;;latter form;;early literature;;century;;characteristics;;neurofibromatosis;;bilateral acoustic neuromas;;early awareness;;assess;;defects;;ans;;classic von recklinghausen syndrome;;intracranial subtype;;subject;;genetic flaws;;clear distinction;;clinicians;;patients;;nf;;pathologic entity;;clinical manifestations;;health;;underlie;;familial ans;;protean manifestations;;syndromes;;neurofibromatoses;;other intracranial tumors;;revealing;;separate chromosomes;;literature;;form;;confusion;;nf type;;few prescient individuals;;neurofibromatosis type;;appreciation;;current era;;generalized form;;article;;types;;bilateral ans;;early history;;evolution;;consensus panel;;intracranial lesions;;origins;;central variety;;disease;;minds;;facet;;last few years;;manifestations;;goals;;national institutes;;investigators;;distinct clinical entity;;descriptions

"tracheal autograft prefabrication using microfibrillar collagen and bone morphogenetic protein. objective: to investigate the feasibility of prefabricating a tracheal autograft capable of microvascular free tissue transfer using microfibrillar collagen (avitene) as a carrier for bone morphogenetic protein (bmp). methods and design: using heterotopic bone induction and soft tissue molding, an attempt was made to prefabricate a homologous tracheal autograft in a rodent free flap model. in 12 male sprague-dawley rats, linear troughs were dissected along the length of the gracillis muscle, filled with bmp-saturated microfibrillar collagen, molded around a silicone tracheal stent, and left pedicled on the femoral vessels. untreated microfibrillar collagen was buried in muscle at a distant control site in 3 animals. autografts were susequently evaluated for lumen integrity, vascular patency, and bone induction at 3 weeks. results: with the exception of 2 nonviable grafts, rings of heterotopic bone were created in all 10 animals. rings spanning at least one third of the tracheal circumference maintained a noncollapsible lumen. microfibrillar collagen was replaced by cancellous bone that reproduced the exact shape and volume of the collagen carrier. the lumen was lined by smooth fibroplasia, and there was no significant inflammatory response, bone exposure, or overgrowth. soft tissue between rings allowed longitudinal flexibility, homologous to the native trachea. bone induction did not occur in any of the control sites. conclusions: microfibrillar collagen is an effective carrier for bmp and may serve as the ideal substrate for tracheal reconstruction without the need for stenting. the potential use of bmp to bioengineer

"angiofibroma: changes in staging and treatment. objective: to identify specific preoperative tumor characteristics and potential surgical decisions that ultimately place a patient at a greater risk for tumor recurrence. design: the clinical presentation, management, and prognosis of 23 consecutive cases of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma were reviewed retrospectively from january 1, 1977, to june 30, 1993. a minimum follow-up of 12 months was necessary for study inclusion. setting: a single, tertiary care pediatric facility. interventions: all available preoperative imaging studies were reevaluated to ensure consistency in reporting. preoperative computed tomography was performed in 21 patients, but only 18 scans were available for review. preoperative angiography with embolization was performed in 21 of 23 patients. surgical excision was the primary mode of treatment in 22 of 23 patients, and complete surgical excision was possible in 21 of 23 patients. main outcome measures: the rate of recurrence was examined with respect to time of presentations, initial tumor stage, intraoperative blood loss, and surgical approach. results: when compared with patients without a recurrent tumor, there was no difference in age at presentation, primary symptom, or duration of symptoms before diagnosis. preoperative tumor stage was found to be the primary factor affecting tumor recurrence. a recurrence rate of 21.7% (five of 23 patients) was identified after an average 6-year follow-up. a trend toward use of the midfacial degloving approach for surgical

"microcystic adnexal carcinoma: case report and review of the literature. microcystic adnexal carcinoma is an aggressive, locally destructive cutaneous neoplasm with a high rate of recurrence. this tumor is often misdiagnosed clinically and histologically. it usually occurs in middle-aged to older adults. we describe a 44-year-old man with a large microcystic adnexal carcinoma that was present for more than 20 years. the tumor invaded the perichondrium, muscle, nerve, and blood vessel adventitia. a review of the literature suggests that these tumors are often histologically misdiagnosed because the biopsy specimens may be too small to reveal all the characteristic histologic features. the clinical presence of marked induration, a smooth surface, and, possibly, sensory changes should alert the clinician to the possibility of this neoplasm. the initial biopsy specimen must be large enough to demonstrate the identifying histologic features. mohs surgery is currently the treatment of choice for microcystic adnexal carcinoma, as it often spreads far beyond clinically evident tumor.

compared with a historical institutional experience of surgical intervention without preliminary localization studies. a 10-year retrospective review from 1985 to 1995 of patients with surgical hyperparathyroidism was performed. setting: academic tertiary referral medical center. patients: thirty-three technetium tc 99m sestamibi scans in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were correlated with eventual surgical and pathologic findings. the last 10 patients were also studied with 10-mhz linear transducer ultrasound, and the results were compared with those of the radionuclide scan and eventual surgical and pathologic findings. from 1985 to 1995, 142 patients underwent surgical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism, and 125 records were available for review. results: the technetium tc 99m sestamibi parathyroid scan correctly identified the site and presence of 31 adenomas among 34 confirmed tumors, a sensitivity of 91% and positive predictive value of 97%. the

"is surgery necessary in stage iii and stage iv cancer of the head and neck that responds to induction chemotherapy?. objective: to study the influence of surgery in patients who achieve a response to induction chemotherapy. design: nonrandomized retrospective study. setting: comprehensive cancer center. patients: the records of all patients with stage iii and stage iv squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx were reviewed at the queensland radium institute, south brisbane, australia, in the years 1970 through 1990. interventions: there were 314 patients where induction chemotherapy was used as part of a curative treatment. complete response occurred in 20 patients, partial response in 110 patients, nonresponse in 162 patients, and unknown response in 22 patients. to assess the impact of surgery, the responders were divided into two treatment groups: one group (n=57) received chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy (c/s/xrt), and a second group (n=73) received chemotherapy and radiotherapy (c/xrt). main outcome measures: five-year survival, local failure, nodal failure, and distant failure. results: the 5-year actuarial survival for the chemotherapy responders and nonresponders was 58% and 43%, respectively (p<.05). when analyzed by treatment group, those receiving c/s/xrt had a 65% 5-year survival (95% confidence intervals [cis], 53 to 78) and those receiving c/xrt had a 56% 5-year survival (95% ci, 44 to 70). however, when the complete responders were assessed, those receiving c/s/xrt had a 90% 5-year survival (95% ci, 72 to 99) vs a 51% survival (95% ci, 18 to 89) for those treated with c/xrt. for the partial responders, the survival for the groups c/s/xrt and c/xrt were 59% (95% ci, 45 to 79) and 53% (95% ci, 41 to 67), respectively. chemotherapy responders were less likely to fail locally if they were treated with c/s/xrt than with c/xrt (21% vs 43%, p<.01). conclusion: the results suggest that surgery still has a

"use of a mechanical microvascular anastomotic device in head and neck free tissue transfer. background: the use of mechanical microvascular anastomotic systems for free tissue transfer has previously been reported. currently, a commercially available coupling device (3m healthcare, st paul, minn) is widely used for various microvascular free flaps. however, to our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature describing the efficacy of this particular device in regard to free tissue transfer in head and neck reconstruction. objective: to describe the surgical technique, limitations, and guidelines for application of this system for vascular anastomosis in head and neck free tissue transfer. design: the microvascular anastomotic device was used in 79 head and neck free flaps: radial forearm (n=28), rectus abdominis (n=27), fibula (n=12), lateral thigh (n=4), iliac crest (n=3), gracilis (n=2), jejunum (n=1), pectoral (n=1), and lateral arm (n=1). follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2.5 years. setting: two major teaching/referral medical centers. participants: seventy-six patients ranging in age from 19 to 86 years. intervention: a total of 105 anastomoses (17 arterial and 88 venous) were performed. outcome measures: anastomotic times and patency rates were evaluated. results: the anastomotic times ranged from 8 to 18 minutes for the arteries (average, 10 minutes) and from 4 to 16 minutes for the veins (average, 5 minutes). none of the flaps resulted in venous congestion due to thrombosis at the anastomosis. two arterial anastomoses resulted in thrombosis, one of which was detected intraoperatively and successfully salvaged with conventional suture anastomosis. conclusions: the patency rates with the microvascular anastomotic system appear to compare favorably with those of standard suture techniques. the major advantage is that the time of venous anastomosis is reduced, thereby decreasing the total ischemic time. an additional advantage is the ease with which anastomoses can be performed when the vessels are deep within a wound, where suture placement is difficult.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:529-532)",free tissue transfer;;neck free tissue

microvascular anastomotic device was used in 79 head and neck free flaps: radial forearm (n=28), rectus abdominis (n=27), fibula (n=12), lateral thigh (n=4), iliac crest (n=3), gracilis (n=2), jejunum (n=1), pectoral (n=1), and lateral arm (n=1).;;follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2.5 years.;;setting: two major teaching/referral medical centers.;;participants: seventy-six patients ranging in age from 19 to 86 years.;;intervention: a total of 105 anastomoses (17 arterial and 88 venous) were performed.;;outcome measures: anastomotic times and patency rates were evaluated.;;results: the anastomotic times ranged from 8 to 18 minutes for the arteries (average, 10 minutes) and from 4 to 16 minutes for the veins (average, 5 minutes).;;none of the flaps resulted in venous congestion due to thrombosis at the anastomosis.;;two arterial anastomoses resulted in thrombosis, one of which was detected intraoperatively and successfully salvaged with conventional suture anastomosis.;;conclusions: the patency rates with the microvascular anastomotic system appear to compare favorably with those of standard suture techniques.;;the major advantage is that the time of venous anastomosis is reduced, thereby decreasing the total ischemic time.;;an additional advantage is the ease with which anastomoses can be performed when the vessels are deep within a wound, where

"neuroectodermal antigens persist in benign and malignant salivary gland tumor cultures. objective: to determine whether a heterogeneous collection of salivary gland tumors shared common antigenic characteristics and growth patterns in tissue culture. design: cell cultures were derived from benign and malignant salivary gland neoplasms, cultured conservatively, and serially analyzed for epithelial, myoepithelial, and neuroectodermal antigens. subjects: nineteen samples reflecting the spectrum of salivary tumor pathologic characteristics were established in tissue culture. most were derived from benign pleomorphic adenomas, and several were from carcinomas, including carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, and mucoepidermoid and adenoid cystic carcinoma. results: all cultures were epithelial as determined by morphologic and antigenic examination, using antibodies for cytokeratin. the phenotype of cells derived from benign tumors, especially the pleomorphic adenomas, resembled those in the original neoplasm. those from carcinomas were similar, with less differentiated characteristics. manipulation of growth conditions altered the phenotypes shown in culture. some cultures contained cells expressing vascular smooth-muscle actin and glial fibrillary acidic protein or nestin. conclusions: this model cell system containing proliferative cells from several tumor types is consistent with a stem-cell theory of salivary gland tumor origin. our data were not consistent with the bicellular or multicellular theory. we hypothesize a neuroectodermal origin for this group of

"apoptotic inhibition of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells by tumor necrosis factor 汐. objectives: to evaluate the effect and mechanism of action of tumor necrosis factor 汐 (tnf-汐) on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) cell lines. specifically, to find out whether tnf-汐 induces apoptotic (programmed) cell death. design: cytotoxicity and kinetics were evaluated through the use of a methylene blue colorimetric assay. the mechanism of cell death was evaluated through gel electrophoresis of extracted dna, double-stranded dna fragmentation, and hoechst 33342每propidium iodide double staining. target cells: four hnscc cell lines were investigated: umscc-1, umscc-8, umscc-19, and cal-27. results: tumor necrosis factor 汐 at a concentration of 10 000 u/ml induced cytotoxic effects in all four cell lines with varying sensitivities. significant cytotoxic effects required 3 to 4 days of exposure to tnf-汐. further experiments demonstrated that tnf-汐 induced double-stranded

"reverse gullibility and scientific evidence. a 19th century image of the medical profession's attitude toward disease transmission is introduced through ignaz semmelweis' hypothesis: infection can be caused by an external agent transmitted when physicans fail to sterilize their hands between patient examinations. semmelweis' test of his hypothesis reduced the obstetrical death rate from 18% to almost 1%. however, he was degraded, defrocked, and driven to death by a profession whose emotions contradicted the evidence. medical professionals like to believe they are not gullible, a trait defined as being easily duped. they rightly believe in their ability to avoid the error of accepting a result not supported by adequate evidence. they are not so free of the complementary error: refusing to accept a result that is supported by adequate evidence, which might be thought of as reverse gullibility. it is just as bad a logical error and just as serious a denial of the best medical care for our patients. clearly semmelweis, and later louis pasteur and others who were disbelieved, were correct. the profession was duped by its emotional adherence to current practice. to be truly professional, let us believe our evidence rather than our biases and not suffer from reverse gullibility.

"correlation of tumor markers p53, bcl-2, cd34, cd44h, cd44v6, and ki-67 with survival and metastasis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. background: recent basic discoveries about the biological significance of nuclear and cell-surface marker proteins have opened new areas of research into head and neck cancer. however, the clinical significance of these markers is not yet understood. objective: to perform a historical prospective study of 70 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx who were treated at our institution between 1979 and 1989 to correlate tumor marker expression with survival and metastasis. design: archival tissue was immunohistochemically stained for the p53 tumor suppressor gene product, the inhibitor of apoptosis (bcl-2), the stem cell marker cd34, the cell adhesion molecules cd44h and cd44v6, and a marker of cellular proliferation (ki-67). the slides were examined using a light microscope and scored according to intensity and percentage of cells labeled. the patients were stratified by tumor stage, and survival and metastatic data were correlated with staining scores. results: for the stage iv group, increased expression of p53 and decreased expression of cd44h and cd44v6 correlated with a decreased survival (p=.03, p=.03, and p=.02, respectively), and decreased expression of cd44h correlated with an increase in metastasis (p=.01). for all stages, excluding metastatic cases, increased p53 expression was consistent with a shorter survival (p<.03), while increased cd44v6 expression was consistent with a longer survival (p<.02). conclusions: the present study suggests that a loss of cell proliferation control implied by overexpression of p53 and loss of cell adhesion implied by decreased expression of cd44 may be

tumor differentiation (p=.004) significantly correlated with the presence or evolution of regional metastases. in addition, tumors involving the symphyseal region were associated with an increased incidence of nodal metastases, although the relationship did not achieve statistical significance (p=.08). occult regional disease was found in 18% of patients who underwent elective neck dissection, and the presence of metastases was pathologically confirmed in 68% who underwent a therapeutic dissection. six patients with clinically no neck disease did not undergo elective dissection and later developed regional metastases. in all patients, survival was adversely impacted by the presence or later development of regional metastases (p<.001). two- and 5-year survival rates for patients with no cervical metastases were 0.91 and 0.85, respectively, while for those with cervical metastases, the survival at 2 and 5 years declined to 0.72 and 0.59. more importantly, the 2- and 5-year

"upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma: the human immunodeficiency virus connection. objective: to evaluate the incidence, distribution, and course of squamous cell carcinoma (scc) of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and compare it to scc in non〞hiv-infected patients. design: case-control study of all patients with scc during a 9.5-year period from january 1985 through june 1994. setting: two academic tertiary care centers in a metropolitan location. participants: five hundred thirty-nine patients (18 to 95 years old) with scc of the upper aerodigestive tract. results: infection with hiv was present in 4.5% of the patients with scc of the upper aerodigestive tract. patients infected with hiv were significantly younger than noninfected patients (p≒<.001), accounting for 21.3% of those patients younger than 45 years (p<.001). no significant difference in tumor location was present between hiv-infected and noninfected patients; however, hiv-infected patients had larger tumors (p=.004) and a more advanced tumor stage (tnm classification) at presentation (p=.05). tumor-related survival was significantly poorer in patients with hiv infection (p=.01), with 57% at 1 year and 32% at 2 years, compared with 74% and 59%, for non〞hiv-infected patients. the detrimental effect of hiv infection on survival remained significant after adjusting for the confounding effects of age, tumor stage, and location of the tumor. all study patients with hiv infection had cancer risk factors such as tobacco and/or alcohol abuse. conclusions: infection with hiv possibly accelerates the development of scc in patients with significant risk factors, presumably by impairing normal immune surveillance mechanisms. the decreased survival rates among these patients suggests that the scc may be more aggressive or that other cofactors assume greater importance. a history of tobacco and/or alcohol abuse in patients with hiv infection warrants aggressive screening and early detection, to allow for early detection, which may help increase survival.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:639-643)",upper aerodigestive tract;;human immunodeficiency virus infection;;hiv-infected patients;;squamous cell carcinoma;;tobacco and or alcohol abuse;;human immunodeficiency virus;;noninfected patients;;alcohol abuse;;tumor stage;;early detection;;non-hiv-infected patients;;two academic tertiary care centers;;human immunodeficiency virus connection;;five hundred thirty-nine patients;;academic tertiary care centers;;hiv-infected and noninfected patients,"upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma: the human immunodeficiency virus connection.;;objective: to evaluate the incidence, distribution, and course of squamous cell carcinoma (scc) of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and compare it to scc in non〞hiv-infected patients.;;design: case-control study of all patients with scc during a 9.5-year period from january 1985 through june 1994. setting: two academic tertiary care centers in a metropolitan location.;;participants: five hundred thirty-nine patients (18 to 95 years old) with scc of the upper aerodigestive tract.;;results: infection with hiv was present in 4.5% of the patients with scc of the upper aerodigestive tract.;;patients infected with hiv were significantly younger than noninfected patients (p≒<.001), accounting for 21.3% of those patients younger than 45 years (p<.001).;;no significant difference in tumor location was present between hiv-infected and noninfected patients;

"regional metastases in patients with advanced laryngeal cancer. objectives: to determine patterns of regional metastases in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and the effect of these patterns on regional and distant tumor recurrence and disease-free and overall survival. methods: one hundred fifty-nine patients treated with conventional surgery and radiation in the veterans affairs cooperative study were studied. ninety-three of the patients underwent modified or classic radical neck dissection. median follow-up was 5 years. patient data collected included age, gender, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and performance status. tumor variables evaluated included tnm classification, tumor site, surface area, presence of ulceration and invasion, and histologic growth pattern. histologically positive regional lymph nodes were examined for level, number, site, and extra-capsular spread. outcome variables included time and location of recurrence, distant metastases, and survival. results: regional metastases were more common in supraglottic than glottic or subglottic tumors (p<.001) and in tumors with larger surface dimensions (p=.004). cervical metastases were associated with decreased disease-free interval (p<.001) and survival (p=.001) and increased distant metastases (p<.001). presence of 3 or more positive nodes predicted distant recurrence (p<.001) and decreased survival (p<.001, multivariate analysis). an analysis of lymph node involvement (levels i-v) indicated that level 1 and 5 involvement was a significant prognostic factor. age, sex, race, and tobacco or alcohol use were not associated with number or extent of regional metastases. conclusions: these findings confirm the prognostic importance of number and level

posterior to the mental foramen, resulting from treatment of head and neck cancer. all patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy. setting: academic tertiary care referral center. interventions: fourteen patients had mandibular continuity restored by using the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system, and 1 patient received a stainless steel mandibular reconstruction plate. associated soft-tissue defects were repaired by using radial forearm (n=11), rectus abdominis (n=2), scapular and parascapular (n=1), or lateral arm (n=1) free flaps. main outcome measures: early and delayed complications. results: all 15 microvascular free tissue transfers were successful. early complications were minor and occurred in 5 (33%) of 15 patients. one patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction. three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction. patients who experienced delayed external plate exposure required secondary reconstruction with a vascularized bone-containing free

patients.;;one patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction.;;three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction.;;patients who experienced delayed external plate exposure required secondary reconstruction with a vascularized bone-containing free flap.;;the overall rate of delayed reconstructive failure was 40% in patients who were followed up for a minimum of 1 year.;;conclusions: for patients who are undergoing free flap reconstruction of lateral mandibulectomy defects, the technique that used soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates has been abandoned in favor of

"interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. background: we hypothesized that in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the overexpression of protumorigenic interleukin-1 (il-1) activity within the tumor tissue is a result of decreased expression of the specific antagonist or inhibitor (ie, il-1 receptor antagonist) by the tumor cells. ultimately, this local overexpression of il-1 activity increases tumor growth and metastasis. design: to test our hypotheses, immunologic analysis for il-1汐, il-1汕, and il-1 receptor antagonist was performed on histologic sections and tumor homogenates of human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. setting: university teaching hospital. patients or other participants: normal and tumor specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgical resections of the head and neck for benign and malignant disease. results: immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of il-1汐, il-1汕, and il-1

"a functional model of nerve repair: reanastomosis vs entubulation repair. objective: to compare reanastomosis and entubulation repair after transection of the peroneal nerve in rats with the use of 2 functional models: gait analysis and a tension transduction device. design: prospective, randomized, blinded control study. each animal served as its own control. the injured site was alternated between the left and the right. gait analysis was evaluated in a blind fashion at postoperative weeks 1, 3, 7, and 13, and the tension transduction device at week 13, for injured and uninjured legs. subjects: animals underwent unilateral peroneal nerve transection injury, half with entubulation and half with end-to-end reanastomosis repair. intervention: nerve transection was performed 6 mm proximal to the anterior tibialis muscle insertion followed by reanastomosis (epineurial suture placement to align the sectioned nerve ends) or entubulation (placement of nerve ends into a 4-mm-long sterile silastic tube secured with 2 epineurial sutures). results: gait analysis demonstrated a poorer ankle angle in all injured legs compared with uninjured legs at each postoperative period. ankle

"keratinocyte differentiation in acquired cholesteatoma and perforated tympanic membranes. objective: to evaluate the type of differentiation of keratinocytes of acquired cholesteatoma and its significance for cholesteatoma invasiveness. design: forty acquired cholesteatomas and 10 tympanic membranes with persisting perforations were snap frozen and processed for immunohistochemical studies. cytokeratin antibodies that represented all subgroups and antibodies that were directed against collagen components of the basal lamina were applied. expression of these constituents was scored by using light microscopy. results: the phenotype of the matrix was generally characterized by an extension of expression of basal cell cytokeratin 14 and hyperproliferation-associated cytokeratins 6, 16, and 17 into the suprabasal cell layers, while the expression of keratinization marker cytokeratin 10 was down-regulated. these features varied greatly at different sites of the matrix and were most marked at the advancing front of the cholesteatoma. a comparable expression pattern, but less pronounced, was observed at the epidermal front of the mucocutaneous junction of the

"pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa: a particular variety of the bacteria?. background: pseudomonas aeruginosa rarely affects the epithelium in healthy persons except for the external ear canal, raising the possibility that p aeruginosa in otitis externa is a specific variety that displays particular characteristics. design: a cohort study was designed to outline distinct characteristics of p aeruginosa in otitis externa compared with p aeruginosa in other infections. the study period was october 1, 1994, to march 27, 1995. patients: isolates of p aeruginosa from nonhospitalized patients were collected at the bacteriological laboratory at karolinska hospital, stockholm, sweden; there were 53 strains of p aeruginosa isolated from otitis externa and 59 strains of p aeruginosa from varicose ulcers and urinary tract infections. methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa was characterized by pigmentation, growth habits, production of mucoid, and biochemical characteristics. results: pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa produced less pyocyanin and less urease and exhibited no mucoid-producing strains. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa displayed fewer of the usual biochemical features of the species than did the strains isolated from other infections. some of these features, such as the production of pyocyanin, are influenced by nutritional factors; strains found in otitis externa probably represent the type of strains present in the natural habitat in water, as opposed to the strains that have adapted to the environment of other human infections. increased knowledge of the characteristics of the strains found in otitis externa is important in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and why p aeruginosa is the dominant infectious agent in otitis externa.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:833-836","otitis externa;;p aeruginosa;;pseudomonas aeruginosa;;pyocyanin;;mucoid , and biochemical characteristics;;external ear canal;;usual biochemical features;;urinary tract infections;;dominant infectious agent;;specific variety;;particular variety;;particular characteristics;;healthy persons;;natural habitat;;varicose ulcers","pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa: a particular variety of the bacteria?.;;background: pseudomonas aeruginosa rarely affects the epithelium in healthy persons except for the external ear canal, raising the possibility that p aeruginosa in otitis externa is a specific variety that displays particular characteristics.;;design: a cohort study was designed to outline distinct characteristics of p aeruginosa in otitis externa compared with p aeruginosa in other infections.;;the study period was october 1, 1994, to march 27, 1995. patients: isolates of p aeruginosa from nonhospitalized patients were collected at the bacteriological laboratory at karolinska hospital, stockholm, sweden; there were 53 strains of p aeruginosa isolated from otitis externa and 59 strains of p aeruginosa from varicose ulcers and urinary tract infections.;;methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa was characterized by pigmentation, growth habits, production of mucoid, and biochemical characteristics.;;results: pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa produced less pyocyanin and less urease and exhibited no mucoid-producing strains.;;conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa in otitis externa displayed fewer of the usual biochemical features of the species than did the strains isolated from other infections.;;some of these features, such as the production of pyocyanin, are influenced by nutritional factors; strains found in otitis externa probably represent the type of strains present in the natural habitat in water, as opposed to the strains that have adapted to the environment of other human infections.;;increased knowledge of the characteristics of the strains found in otitis externa is important in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and why p aeruginosa is the dominant infectious agent in otitis externa.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1996;122:833-836",methods;;other infections;;characteristics;;results;;understanding;;disease;;usual biochemical features;;design;;urinary tract infections;;bacteria;;features;;knowledge;;strains;;specific variety;;affects;;varicose ulcers;;pathogenesis;;species;;environment;;pyocyanin;;production;;cohort study;;distinct characteristics;;less pyocyanin;;isolates;;pigmentation;;type;;otitis externa;;raising;;particular variety;;otitis;;conclusions;;nonhospitalized patients;;possibility;;natural habitat;;water;;bacteriological laboratory;;otitis externa.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;mucoid-producing strains;;particular characteristics;;background;;pseudomonas;;other human infections;;external ear;;study period;;nutritional factors;;october;;karolinska hospital;;less urease;;biochemical characteristics;;epithelium;;patients;;stockholm;;healthy persons;;dominant infectious agent;;growth habits;;p aeruginosa
"a sensitive animal model to assess acute and chronic ototoxic effects. background: ototoxic side effects of aminoglycosides or cisplatin are strongly influenced by the nutritional state of the experimental animal. we previously demonstrated that guinea pigs fed a low-protein diet are a sensitive model to investigate chronic ototoxic effects of drugs. we now demonstrate that this model is equally sensitive to acute ototoxic insults. subjects and design: guinea pigs were fed either a full-protein (18.5% protein) or a low-protein (7% protein) diet. gentamicin sulfate was given as a single injection (100 mg/kg of body weight subcutaneously), followed 90 minutes later by varying concentrations of ethacrynic acid intravenously. auditory function was assessed by auditory brain-stem response and morphologic characteristics in surface preparations of the organ of corti. results: in animals fed a full-protein diet, 35 mg of ethacrynic acid per kilogram of body weight was required for a significant threshold shift at all frequencies tested (3, 8, and 18 khz). in animals fed a low-protein diet, 15 mg of ethacrynic acid per kilogram significantly elevated threshold at all frequencies, and 20 mg/kg caused a profound threshold shift (>90 db). hair cell loss in the organ of corti paralleled the pathophysiological findings. conclusions: a metabolically challenged animal may better represent the situation of a severely ill patient undergoing drug therapy. therefore, studies in diet-restricted animals may be more appropriate than studies in healthy animals for an assessment of potential adverse therapeutic side effects.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:837-840",ethacrynic acid;;chronic ototoxic effects;;guinea pigs;;low-protein diet;;low-protein;;full-protein;;potential adverse therapeutic side effects;;per kilogram significantly elevated threshold;;aminoglycosides or cisplatin;;ototoxic side effects;;sensitive animal model;;severely ill patient;;hair cell loss;;subjects and design;;profound threshold shift;;auditory brain-stem response,"a sensitive animal model to assess acute and chronic ototoxic effects.;;background: ototoxic side effects of aminoglycosides or cisplatin are strongly influenced by the nutritional state of the experimental animal.;;we previously demonstrated that guinea pigs fed a low-protein diet are a sensitive model to investigate chronic ototoxic effects of drugs.;;we now demonstrate that this model is equally sensitive to acute ototoxic insults.;;subjects and design: guinea pigs were fed either a full-protein (18.5% protein) or a low-protein (7% protein) diet.;;gentamicin sulfate was given as a single injection (100 mg/kg of body weight subcutaneously), followed 90 minutes later by varying concentrations of ethacrynic acid intravenously.;;auditory function was assessed by auditory brain-stem response and morphologic characteristics in surface preparations of the organ of corti.;;results: in animals fed a full-protein diet, 35 mg of ethacrynic acid per kilogram of body weight was required for a significant threshold shift at all frequencies tested (3, 8, and 18 khz).;;in animals fed a low-protein diet, 15 mg of ethacrynic acid per kilogram significantly elevated threshold at all frequencies, and 20 mg/kg caused a profound threshold shift (>90 db).;;hair cell loss in the organ of corti paralleled the pathophysiological findings.;;conclusions: a metabolically challenged animal may better represent the situation of a severely ill patient undergoing drug therapy.;;therefore, studies in diet-restricted animals may be more appropriate than studies in healthy animals for an assessment of potential adverse therapeutic side effects.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1996;122:837-840",nutritional state;;khz;;represent;;sensitive model;;assessment;;auditory function;;results;;single injection;;varying concentrations;;aminoglycosides;;design;;chronic ototoxic effects;;body weight;;threshold;;ototoxic insults;;sensitive animal model;;profound threshold shift;;pathophysiological findings;;guinea pigs;;subjects;;conclusions;;full-protein diet;;morphologic characteristics;;low-protein diet;;diet-restricted animals;;drugs;;auditory brain-stem response;;ethacrynic acid;;ill patient;;diet;;studies;;background;;db;;surface preparations;;significant threshold shift;;model;;healthy animals;;% protein;;mg;;animals;;organ;;cell loss;;kilogram;;gentamicin;;low-protein (;;corti;;drug therapy;;frequencies;;situation;;assess acute;;full-protein (;;minutes;;ototoxic side effects

"absent vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in vestibular neurolabyrinthitis: an indicator of inferior vestibular nerve involvement?. background: benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (bppv) is generally thought to be caused by canalolithiasis in the posterior semicircular canal, an organ that is innervated by the inferior vestibular nerve. we hypothesized that absent vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (vemps) would indicate involvement of the inferior vestibular nerve and that posterior semicircular canal〞type bppv could not develop after vestibular neurolabyrinthitis (vnl) in patients with absent vemps. objective: to find out if vemps could be helpful in evaluating involvement of the inferior vestibular nerve in acute vnl. design: we reviewed the vemp findings in 47 patients (34 men and 13 women) with acute vnl, 10 of whom had then developed posterior semicircular canal〞type bppv. results: while p13-n23, the first positive-negative peak of the vemp, was ipsilaterally present on stimulation of the unaffected side in all patients, it was absent on the affected side in 16 patients (34%). the absence or presence of p13-n23 was independent of the results of caloric tests, pure tone audiometry, and auditory brain-stem responses. typical posterior semicircular canal bppv developed in 10 of the 47 patients after the acute attack of vnl, always on the same side as the neurolabyrinthitis. the p13-n23 potentials were preserved on stimulation of the affected ear in all 10 patients with bppv. conclusions: these results suggest that if vemps are absent from an ear that has suffered acute vnl, then posterior semicircular canal bppv is unlikely to develop as a consequence of the vnl. the reason for this appears to be that the absence of vemps is due to involvement of the inferior vestibular nerve or involvement of the structures that it innervates.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:845-848",posterior semicircular canal;;inferior vestibular

"plasma endothelin level in the acute stage of bell palsy. objective: to determine the plasma endothelin level in the acute stage in patients with bell palsy (based on the hypothesis that endothelin, which is a potent vasoconstrictor, may play a role in the mechanism of the onset of facial nerve paralysis and in view of the fact that the etiology of bell palsy is still a maze of unknowns). design: the study involved 62 patients with the acute stage (tested within 10 days of onset) of bell palsy (ie, idiopathic acute peripheral facial paralysis) and an additional 36 healthy persons who served as control subjects. to determine the content of endothelin, 2 ml of plasma samples was collected from each subject. endothelin-1 was extracted and analyzed by a radioimmunoassay by using anti〞endothelin-1 antibody. setting: nihon university itabashi hospital, a referral and institutional center in tokyo, japan. results: the patients who were suffering from bell palsy exhibited a statistically significant (p<.01) increase in the endothelin level compared with that in the 36 normal control subjects. an age-matched comparison (ranges, 20-29 years and 30-39 years) of patients with bell palsy with normal control subjects revealed a significant difference between the normal group and the group with bell palsy in the plasma endothelin level for both age groups that were tested (p<.01). the mean value of the endothelin level in patients with bell palsy was maximal on day 5, and the percentage of patients with abnormally elevated endothelin levels was 100% from days 6 to 9. conclusion: endothelin, which has potent vasoconstrictive effects, may contribute to the pathogenesis of the microcirculatory impairment that occurs in patients with bell palsy, mainly by promoting secondary ischemia.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:849-852",bell palsy;;endothelin level;;endothelin;;plasma endothelin level;;acute stage;;control subjects;;normal control subjects;;idiopathic acute peripheral facial paralysis;;abnormally elevated endothelin levels;;additional 36 healthy persons;;nihon university itabashi hospital;;facial nerve paralysis;;potent vasoconstrictive effects;;elevated endothelin levels;;potent vasoconstrictor,"plasma endothelin level in the acute stage of bell palsy.;;objective: to determine the plasma endothelin level in the acute stage in patients with bell palsy (based on the hypothesis that endothelin, which is a potent vasoconstrictor, may play a role in the mechanism of the onset of facial nerve paralysis and in view of the fact that the etiology of bell palsy is still a maze of unknowns).;;design: the study involved 62 patients with the acute stage (tested within 10 days of onset) of bell palsy (ie, idiopathic acute peripheral facial paralysis) and an additional 36 healthy persons who served as control subjects.;;to determine the content of endothelin, 2 ml of plasma samples was collected from each subject.;;endothelin-1 was extracted and analyzed by a radioimmunoassay by using anti〞endothelin-1 antibody.;;setting: nihon university itabashi hospital, a referral and institutional center in tokyo, japan.;;results: the patients who were suffering from bell palsy exhibited a statistically significant (p<.01) increase in the endothelin level compared with that in the 36 normal control subjects.;;an age-matched comparison (ranges, 20-29 years and 30-39 years) of patients with bell palsy with normal control subjects revealed a significant difference between the normal group and the group with bell palsy in the plasma endothelin level for both age groups that were tested (p<.01).;;the mean value of the endothelin level in patients with bell palsy was maximal on day 5, and the percentage of patients with abnormally elevated endothelin levels was 100% from days 6 to 9. conclusion: endothelin, which has potent vasoconstrictive effects, may contribute to the pathogenesis of the microcirculatory impairment that occurs in patients with bell palsy, mainly by promoting secondary ischemia.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1996;122:849-852",significant difference;;results;;years;;conclusion;;design;;pathogenesis;;bell palsy;;japan;;age-matched comparison;;ie;;institutional center;;subject;;content;;vasoconstrictive effects;;group;;radioimmunoassay;;endothelin level;;mechanism;;onset;;endothelin;;role;;plasma endothelin level;;objective;;maze;;percentage;;idiopathic acute peripheral facial paralysis;;normal group;;microcirculatory impairment;;age groups;;endothelin levels;;normal control subjects;;ranges;;hypothesis;;day;;significant ( p;;tokyo;;facial nerve paralysis;;ml;;study;;days;;control subjects;;plasma samples;;etiology;;unknowns;;patients;;nihon university itabashi hospital;;healthy persons;;potent vasoconstrictor;;mean value;;increase;;antibody;;acute stage;;fact;;view
"a novel organ preservation protocol for advanced carcinoma of the larynx and pharynx. objective: to pilot a targeted chemoradiation protocol for patients with advanced carcinoma of the larynx and

delivered to the tumor bulk, simultaneous intravenous sodium thiosulfate for systemic drug neutralization, and conventional external-beam irradiation (1.80-2.00 gy per fraction ℅35) were used. between february 1991 and april 1994, 42 patients were treated who would otherwise have required a major resection of the tongue base, pharyngeal wall, or larynx. main outcome measures: tumor response, toxic effects, disease control above the clavicle, preservation of the larynx, maintenance of oral nutrition, and overall and disease-related 2-year survival. results: three complications were related to the weekly transfemoral superselective intra-arterial procedures performed 160 times. grade 3 to 4 chemotoxic effects were infrequent, occurring in 9 (5.5%) of 160 cycles, and only 1 patient required

"assessing vocal function after chemoradiation for advanced laryngeal carcinoma. objective: to identify objective parameters that could serve as valid indicators of vocal function in evaluating patients treated at multiple centers for head and neck cancer. design: objective measures of voice were validated against functional outcome measures of voice and communication. setting: a multidisciplinary university-based ambulatory head and neck cancer clinic. subjects: fifteen patients at varying posttreatment intervals after chemoradiation therapy for head and neck cancer and 5 volunteers with no cancer but with a history of heavy smoking and drinking. main outcome measures: acoustic and aerodynamic parameters were measured in patients with head and neck cancer after treatment with combined chemotherapy and irradiation and in control subjects. communicative function was assessed by perceptual assessment of recorded voice samples, by a clinician-based communication score, and by patient self-rating of voice and communication. results: both perceptual analyis and communication score were concordant with patient self-rating of voice and communication ability. acoustic measures were abnormal in patients, and jitter scores correlated with listener ratings of perceived voice quality. however, acoustic measures did not relate to communication function, as assessed by either the patient or the clinician. laryngeal resistance demonstrated a significant correlation with both patient and observer assessments of voice quality and communication function. laryngeal resistance was on average twice as high in patients who complained of voice fatigue, but this difference was not statistically significant. conclusions: laryngeal resistance, determined during standardized phonation, is a reliable objective parameter of vocal function after chemoradiation therapy for head and neck cancer. a standardized clinician-based communication scale holds promise as a useful tool. acoustic measures reflect the sound of the voice but not the ability to communicate effectively.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:858-864",neck cancer;;voice and

"generation of therapeutic t cells from draining lymph nodes in a murine model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. objectives: to study immunotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using at-84, a spontaneously arising murine tumor. we examined the draining lymph nodes (dlns) for generation of potential therapeutic lymphocytes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. design: experimental randomized control trial. intervention: therapeutic t cells from dlns were generated by the sequential activation of the in vivoprimed dln cells with 2c11, an anti-cd3 antibody, and interleukin-2 (il-2). immunotherapy of mice bearing lung metastases was carried out in various experiments with low-dose systemic il-2 and activated dln cells. using a 4-hour radioactive chromium cr 51 release assay, in vitro cytotoxicity of these cells also was examined. results: mice immunized with this tumor failed to reject the growth of a subsequent challenge with the tumor. immunotherapy with low-dose systemic il-2 resulted in a mean reduction of 79% in the number of lung metastases. adoptive immunotherapy with activated dln cells was effective in all experiments, with a mean reduction of 59% in the number of metastases in immunodeficient mice. however, dln cells were not directly cytotoxic to the tumor cells in in vitro assays, unlike control lymphokine-activated killer cells. conclusions: at-84 is a nonimmunogenic tumor similar to many human malignant neoplasms, making this a suitable model for immunotherapy. low-dose systemic il-2 was effective in reduction of established metastasis in this model. activated dln cells show reproducible in vivo therapeutic efficacy despite lack of in vitro cytotoxicity. use of dln cells as sources of therapeutic t cells in

"successful treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma with combined chemotherapy and proton radiation: results in 9 cases. objective: to study the efficacy of a newly designed treatment strategy for esthesioneuroblastoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses. design and setting: nonrandomized prospective study of a case series in a tertiary referral center. patients: nine consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esthesioneuroblastoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses from june 1992 to october 1995 underwent this treatment protocol. interventions: after histological diagnosis and detailed imaging, 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy were instituted. chemotherapy responders were treated with combined photon and stereotaxic fractionated proton radiation therapy totaling approximately 68 gy to the primary site, whereas poor responders were treated with surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation. in both cases, therapy was then concluded with 2 additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. main outcomes measures: response to therapy, survival, disease-free survival, and complications of therapy were examined. results: nine patients with a median dulguerov t stage of t3 (range, t2 to t4) completed the treatment protocol, with mean follow-up after diagnosis of 20.5 months. eight of 9 patients exhibited a dramatic response to therapy with remission of their tumor, and resection was not required. one patient failed to respond to induction chemotherapy and received surgical therapy to be followed by postoperative radiotherapy. there have been no recurrences (mean disease-free interval of 14.0 months). complications were limited and generally transient. conclusions: the use of

"brief bilateral vocal cord paralysis after insecticide poisoning: a new variant of toxicity syndrome. we describe a new variant of life-threatening organophosphate toxicity syndrome that produces a brief bilateral vocal cord paralysis. there are 3 recognized types of toxicity syndrome: acute (instantaneous), intermediate (slightly delayed, ie, hours to days), and delayed (weeks to months). ingestions of large doses of insecticides lead to a cholinergic crisis and possible death (acute-type syndrome). exposures to lower doses may cause the intermediate- or delayed-type syndrome. the intermediate-type syndrome is characterized by slightly delayed polyneuropathy and generalized weakness. transient vocal cord paralysis has also been reported in association with other neurologically profound findings. the delayed-type syndrome can produce muscle weakness for months. our patient, a 2-year-old boy, was found eating a substance later found to be contaminated with insecticide. within minutes, fever and somnolence developed, followed by progressive respiratory distress and stridor, without generalized weakness. the child's condition progressed to complete airway obstruction, and intubation was necessary. emergency laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy were performed to rule out epiglottitis or a foreign body. instead, a bilateral vocal cord paralysis was found. the paralysis lasted 2 days before completely resolving. insecticide poisoning was suspected. we theorize that our patient manifested a combination of the acute-type syndrome, because of the immediacy of the onset of the symptoms (ie, fever and somnolence), and the intermediate-type syndrome, because of the transient vocal cord paralysis. because of the potential dangers involved, we wish to familiarize physicians concerning organophosphate poisoning;

"mitochondrial dna deletions associated with aging and presbyacusis. background: the membrane hypothesis of aging proposes an association between reactive oxygen metabolites and aging processes. reactive oxygen metabolites are a normal by-product of oxidative phosphorylation and are also formed under conditions of ischemia, hypoperfusion, and as a result of environmental contaminants. among the many detrimental activities of reactive oxygen metabolites, also known as free oxygen radicals, is direct damage to mitochondrial dna. progressive accumulation of mitochondrial dna damage renders cells unable to conduct oxidative phosphorylation reactions effectively, thereby leading to a bioenergetically deficient cell. over time, mitochondrial dna damage accumulates and leads to cellular dysfunction with subsequent organ failure, aging, and ultimately, death. this sequence forms the basis of the membrane hypothesis of aging. objective: to determine if the membrane hypothesis of aging may be involved in the development of presbyacusis. design: fischer rats from 4 age groups were tested for auditory sensitivity using the auditory brainstem response. brain, stria vascularis, and auditory nerve tissues were harvested and mitochondrial dna was amplified to identify the highly conserved cytochrome b and nd1-16s ribosomal rna segment of the nadh genes, as well as a 4834每base pair

"quality of life for children with otitis media. objective: to evaluate changes in health-related quality of life for children with otitis media. design: cohort study using a 6-item quality-of-life survey (om-6) representing the domains of physical suffering, hearing loss, speech impairment, emotional distress, activity limitations, and caregiver concerns. setting: hospital-based pediatric otolaryngology practice in a metropolitan area. patients: one hundred eighty-six children aged 6 months to 12 years (median age, 3.4 years) with chronic otitis media with effusion or recurrent acute otitis media. intervention: the om-6 was completed at entry by the child's caregiver and again at least 4 weeks after routine clinical care. otoscopic findings, static admittance, tympanometric width, audiometric thresholds, and ear-related global quality of life (10-point visual scale) were recorded concurrently. main outcome measures: test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness to longitudinal change of the om-6 survey score (mean value of the 6 items). results: excellent test-retest reliability was obtained for the survey score (r=0.87) and individual survey items (r≡0.71). the median survey score was 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.7-3.0) of a maximum 7.0, with higher values indicating poorer quality of life. construct validity was shown by significant correlations between the survey score and global ear-related quality of life (r=每0.64), between physical suffering and physician visits in the past month (r=0.47), and between caregiver concerns and

ventilation〞induced stenosis. design: a case series of 41 patients consecutively treated with cricotracheal anastomosis. setting: a tertiary care center and university teaching hospital. patients: group 1 consisted of 22 patients with stenosis reaching the lower border of the cricoid cartilage that did not require resection of the cricoid cartilage. group 2 consisted of 19 patients in whom correction of the stenosis required cricoid resection. main outcome measures: statistical analysis of airway patency was based on the kaplan-meier actuarial life table method. incidence for the various postoperative complications was presented. univariate analysis was performed to analyze the relationships between various factors, airway patency, and the incidence for the various complications encountered. results: the kaplan-meier 5-year airway patency estimate was 100% in group 1 patients and 82.5% in group 2 patients. in group 2 patients, complementary treatment with dilatations in 2 patients resulted in an overall 94.8% airway patency rate. in the last patient, the airway patency was not reestablished after cricotracheal anastomosis, and a montgomery t tube was inserted. postoperative complications included unilateral inferior laryngeal nerve paralysis (3 patients), cervical neck abscess (2 patients), pneumothorax (1 patient), and major subcutaneous emphysema (1 patient). none of the following variables was statistically related to the airway patency or to the various complications encountered: sex, age, cause for stenosis, delay from initial injury, prior treatment, presence of a tracheotomy, number of tracheal rings resected, type of sutures used, and type of anastomosis performed. conclusions: the data reported reemphasized that

"clinical outcome of continuous facial nerve monitoring during primary parotidectomy. objectives: to assess whether continuous facial nerve monitoring during parotidectomy is associated with a lower incidence of facial nerve paresis or paralysis compared with parotidectomy without monitoring and to assess the cost of such monitoring. design: a retrospective analysis of outcomes for patients who underwent parotidectomy with or without continuous facial nerve monitoring. setting: university medical center. patients: fifty-six patients undergoing parotidectomy in whom continuous electromyographic monitoring was used and 61 patients in whom it was not used. main outcome measures: (1) the incidence of early and persistent facial nerve paresis or paralysis and (2) the cost associated with facial nerve monitoring. results: early, unintentional facial weakness was significantly lower in the group monitored by electromyograpy (43.6%) than in the unmonitored group (62.3%) (p=.04). in the subgroup of patients without comorbid conditions or surgeries, early weakness in the monitored group (33.3%) remained statistically lower than the rate of early weakness in the unmonitored group (57.5%) (p=.03). there was no statistical difference in the final facial nerve function or incidence of permanent nerve injury between the groups or subgroups. after multivariate analysis, nonmonitored status (odds ratio [or], 3.22), advancing age (or, 1.47 per 10 years), and longer operative times (or, 1.3 per hour) were the only significant independent predictive variables significantly associated with early postoperative facial weakness. the incremental cost of facial nerve monitoring was $379. conclusions: the results suggest that continuous electromyographic monitoring of facial muscle during primary parotidectomy reduces the incidence of shortterm postoperative facial paresis. advantages and disadvantages of this technique need to be considered together with the additional costs in deciding whether routine use of continuous monitoring is a useful, cost-effective adjunct to parotid surgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;157:1081-1087","facial

"a new classification and diagnostic criteria for invasive fungal sinusitis. objective: to develop criteria for the diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis. design: review of the literature on invasive fungal sinusitis in the context of a population of 30 patients with fungal sinusitis and 24 patients with chronic bacterial sinusitis. setting: tertiary care medical center. results: our review revealed no consensus in the literature on the classification of the syndromes of invasive fungal sinusitis and no criteria for their diagnosis. moreover, the existing syndromes of invasive fungal sinusitis lacked specificity and one of the more commonly cited syndromes, primary aspergillosis of the paranasal sinuses, is a granulomatous disease that occurs rarely outside africa. two of our 30 patients with fungal sinusitis had a previously unrecognized form of invasive disease. both were middle-aged adults with wellcontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, apical orbital syndrome, and a similar course: proptosis resulting from fungal expansion out of an ethmoid sinus, a protracted illness of 6 months or longer, visual changes, late neurological symptoms reflecting cavernous sinus invasion, and death. the syndrome in these 2 patients is distinct from the syndrome of fulminant invasive fungal sinusitis, (eg, mucormycosis) with nasal eschar, intracerebral fungal dissemination by vascular invasion, and death in days, and the granulomatous form. conclusions: we conclude that there are 3 forms of invasive fungal sinusitis and propose that they be termed (1) granulomatous, (2) acute fulminant, and (3) chronic invasive. the latter category reflects the syndrome seen in our 2 patients. furthermore, the following 2 diagnostic criteria for invasive fungal sinusitis are proposed: (1) sinusitis confirmed by radiological imaging and (2) histopathological evidence of hyphal forms within sinus mucosa, submucosa, blood vessels, or bone. the specificity of hyphae within sinus mucosa for

and hemicricoid cartilages. design: case series review of 6 patients treated during a 2 ?-year period with an average follow-up of 23 months. factors evaluated included oncologic outcome, as well as functional outcome with regard to the onset and quality of the airway, speech, and deglutition. setting: mount sinai school of medicine, new york, ny, an academic, tertiary referral center. patients: six men ranging in age from 51 to 73 years underwent a partial laryngopharyngectomy that included the hemicricoid and hemithyroid cartilages as well as the ipsilateral thyroid lobe and either unilateral or bilateral lymph node dissections for squamous cell cancer that involved the apex of the pyriform sinus. intervention: these extensive laryngopharyngeal defects were reconstructed with a sensate radial forearm flap that resurfaced the endolarynx, restored the depth of the pyriform sinus, and reconstructed the remainder of the hypopharynx. in the final 4 patients, a free costal cartilage graft was used to restore the infrastructure of the larynx. outcome measures: the status of the margins, the incidence and site of recurrent cancer, the quality of speech, and the times to

"expression of p53 protein in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma before and after chemotherapy. background: the expression of p53 protein has been reported to be in the range of 35% to 67% in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). mutations of the gene for p53 protein have been associated with rapidly proliferating tumors, and p53 protein expression has been shown to be a significant predictor of worse survival in surgically resected hnscc. to determine whether p53 protein expression in advanced (stages iii and iv) hnscc has any impact on tumor response to 2 to 3 courses of paclitaxel (taxol) and carboplatin, we prospectively studied prechemotherapy specimens from patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage hnscc. we also attempted to study residual tumors after chemotherapy to determine if the p53 status of the tumor changed. design: the expression of p53 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis (clone bp53-12-1; bio-genex, san ramon, calif). setting: tertiary university medical center. intervention: two to 3 courses of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. main outcome measures: pathologic complete remission or residual tumor. results: the results of p53 immunostaining were positive in 24 (67%) of 36 hnscc specimens before chemotherapy. after chemotherapy, 8 patients achieved pathologic complete remission. before chemotherapy, the tumor was p53 negative in 2 patients and positive in 6 patients. conclusions: no correlation of p53 protein expression with response to chemotherapy was noted. the expression of p53 protein converted from positive to negative in 5 (42%) of 12 specimens from patients with residual tumor after chemotherapy, with no impact on clinical outcome.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1223-1225","p53 protein;;p53 protein expression;;residual tumor;;neck squamous cell carcinoma;;head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;;pathologic complete remission;;previously untreated , advanced-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;;stages iii and iv;;surgically resected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;;head and neck squamous cell carcinoma specimens;;main outcome measures;;rapidly proliferating tumors;;paclitaxel;;resected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma","expression of p53 protein in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma before and after chemotherapy.;;background: the expression of p53 protein has been reported to be in the range of 35% to 67% in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc).;;mutations of the gene for p53 protein have been associated with rapidly proliferating tumors, and p53 protein expression has been shown to be a significant predictor of worse survival in surgically resected hnscc.;;to determine whether p53 protein expression in advanced (stages iii and iv) hnscc has any impact on tumor response to 2 to 3 courses of paclitaxel (taxol) and carboplatin, we prospectively studied prechemotherapy specimens from patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage hnscc.;;we also attempted to study residual tumors after chemotherapy to determine if the p53 status of the tumor changed.;;design: the expression of p53 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis (clone bp53-12-1; bio-genex, san ramon, calif).;;setting: tertiary university medical center.;;intervention: two to 3 courses of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin.;;main outcome measures: pathologic complete remission or residual tumor.;;results: the results of p53 immunostaining were positive in 24 (67%) of 36 hnscc specimens before chemotherapy.;;after chemotherapy, 8 patients achieved pathologic complete remission.;;before chemotherapy, the tumor was p53 negative in 2 patients and positive in 6 patients.;;conclusions: no correlation of p53 protein expression with response to chemotherapy was noted.;;the expression of p53 protein converted from positive to negative in 5 (42%) of 12 specimens from patients with residual tumor after chemotherapy, with no impact on clinical outcome.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:1223-1225",pathologic complete remission;;clinical outcome.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;advanced head;;iv;;design;;p53 status;;tumor response;;immunohistochemical analysis;;intervention;;impact;;tertiary university medical center;;study residual tumors;;hnscc specimens;;worse survival;;patients;;san ramon;;hnscc;;advanced-stage hnscc;;chemotherapy;;advanced ( stages;;main;;specimens;;head;;conclusions;;clone;;measures;;results;;neck squamous cell carcinoma;;mutations;;p53 protein;;carboplatin;;background;;response;;p53;;residual tumor;;prechemotherapy specimens;;paclitaxel;;tumors;;p53 protein expression;;taxol;;tumor;;courses;;range;;correlation;;significant predictor;;gene;;expression;;p53 immunostaining
"human papillomavirus expression and p53 gene mutations in squamous cell carcinoma. objectives: to determine the incidence of human papillomavirus (hpv) infection and p53 gene mutation expression in squamous cell carcinomas (sccs) of the oral cavity and tonsils, to correlate the presence of hpv and p53 gene mutation with known clinical and pathological features of scc, and to determine whether infection with hpv or the presence of p53 gene mutations are independent prognosticators of patient survival. design: to accomplish this goal, 58 patients with sccs of the oral cavity and 42 patients with sccs of the tonsils were randomly examined. the cases examined met the criteria of 5-year clinical follow-up, availability of complete staging information and treatment history, and the presence of paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. immunohistochemical tests were performed to identify the mutant p53 protein. human papillomavirus identification was accomplished with polymerase chain reaction, with confirmation via restriction fragment length polymorphisms. results: the incidence of p53 gene mutation expression for this series was 66%. human papillomavirus infection was found in 11 patients (11%). there was a trend toward increased p53 gene mutation expression with advancing stage of tumor in the oral cavity cancer group, although this was less evident in the tonsil cancer population. the p53 gene mutation status was found not to correlate with the histological grade of the tumor, patient age or sex, recurrence rates, or survival status. like p53 expression, there were no correlations found between the presence of hpv and age, sex, histological grade, or recurrence rates. however, a correlation did exist between hpv and survival status in the tonsil cancer group, with improved survival noted among patients with tonsil cancers infected with hpv compared with those not infected with hpv. a significant correlation existed with both p53 gene mutation status and hpv status with respect to alcohol and tobacco use. the presence of the p53 gene mutation positively correlated with increased tobacco and alcohol use, whereas infection with hpv predicted a significantly lower rate of alcohol and tobacco consumption. conclusions: human papillomavirus infection is an independent risk factor for the development of oral cavity and tonsil sccs in those patients with a relatively low alcohol and tobacco use history. conversely, there is a strong association between heavy alcohol and tobacco use and mutation of the p53 gene. neither p53 gene mutation nor hpv

"management of oropharyngeal trauma in children. objective: to determine the indications for admission, requisite imaging studies, and urgent medical or surgical intervention. design: we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 26 children (age range, 5 months to 14 years) who were seen by the otolaryngology service in the emergency department at the children's national medical center, washington, dc, from 1985 to 1993 and who were diagnosed as having oropharyngeal trauma. we specifically looked for common findings in the history and physical examination on initial presentation to predict the necessary steps in evaluation and management. setting: tertiary care pediatric referral center. results: indications for admission were (1) concern about neurologic injury, (2) concern about vascular injury, (3) radiographic evidence of retropharyngeal free air or abscess, (4) pneumomediastinum, and (5) unreliable adult supervision at home. six patients required surgery: 3 underwent retropharyngeal aspiration or incision and drainage procedures; 2 required neck explorations; and 1, who had an impaled foreign body in the parapharyngeal space, underwent surgical extraction. there were no vascular, neurologic, or other permanent injuries. conclusions: oropharyngeal trauma may result in palatal and posterior pharyngeal wall injury requiring closure of lacerations and management of retropharyngeal free air. rarely does an injury lead to retropharyngeal abscess or significant pneumomediastinum. lateral oropharyngeal injuries require increased concern about potential neurovascular impairment. however, neither the mechanism of injury nor the degree of injury correlates with the potential for neurovascular sequelae. since neurovascular involvement may not become clinically apparent until days or weeks after the incident, admission for observation alone should be based on the distance from the patient's home to the hospital and on the level of reliable adult supervision. indications for medical and surgical treatment of internal carotid artery thrombosis remain controversial.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1267-1270",oropharyngeal trauma;;reliable adult supervision;;retropharyngeal free air;;urgent medical or surgical intervention;;retropharyngeal free air or abscess;;required neck explorations;;history and physical examination;;posterior pharyngeal wall injury;;internal carotid artery thrombosis;;six patients required surgery;;medical and surgical treatment;;requisite imaging studies;;evaluation and management;;unreliable adult supervision;;potential neurovascular impairment,"management of oropharyngeal trauma in children.;;objective: to determine the indications for admission, requisite imaging studies, and urgent medical or surgical intervention.;;design: we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 26 children (age range, 5 months to 14 years) who were seen by the otolaryngology service in the emergency department at the children's national medical center, washington, dc, from 1985 to 1993 and who were diagnosed as having oropharyngeal trauma.;;we specifically looked for common findings in the history and physical examination on initial presentation to predict the necessary steps in evaluation and management.;;setting: tertiary care pediatric referral center.;;results: indications for admission were (1) concern about neurologic injury, (2) concern about vascular injury, (3) radiographic evidence of retropharyngeal free air or abscess, (4) pneumomediastinum, and (5) unreliable adult supervision at home.;;six patients required surgery: 3 underwent retropharyngeal aspiration or incision and drainage procedures;

"relative incidence and alternative approaches for surgical drainage of different types of deep neck abscesses in children. objectives: to determine the relative frequency of retropharyngeal abscesses (rpas) vs lateral pharyngeal abscesses (lpas) and to analyze alternative approaches for surgical drainage. design: retrospective chart review. setting: tertiary care children's hospital. patients: seventy pediatric patients who were evaluated, admitted, and treated for presumed deep neck abscesses (rpas and lpas) between january 1, 1986, and december 31, 1996. intervention: intravenous antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. main outcome measure: clinical resolution of the abscess. results: fifty-eight patients were evaluated with computed tomographic scan. thirteen of these patients did not have surgical intervention. of 12 patients diagnosed as having an isolated rpa, all had intraoral surgical drainage and 9 had evidence of pus at surgery. twenty-one patients had an isolated lpa. sixteen of these underwent intraoral drainage and 5 underwent external drainage. purulence was found at surgery in 14 and 2 patients, respectively. the remaining 12 patients had a combination of rpa and lpa. eight patients underwent intraoral drainage, and 4 patients required both intraoral and external approaches. purulence was found at surgery in 5 and 4 patients, respectively. of the 12 patients who were not evaluated with computed tomographic scan, two thirds were treated prior to 1987. six of these 12 patients underwent surgical drainage via an intraoral approach, and 4 of the 6 patients had pus. the remaining 6 improved without surgery. conclusions: most deep neck abscesses in children are located in the retropharyngeal or in the lateral pharyngeal space medial to the great vessels. therefore, most can be managed successfully with intraoral rather than external drainage. external approaches are better reserved for those abscesses that are lateral to the great vessels or that involve multiple spaces. in this patient population, lpas were more commonly seen than rpas.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1271-1275",surgical

"汐-difluoromethylornithine ototoxicity: chemoprevention clinical trial results. objectives: to determine the effects of low-dose oral eflornithine hydrochloride (difluoromethylornithine [dfmo]) administration on hearing and to identify factors that influence those effects. design: combined data from 2 studies: a prospective, randomized phase 1 clinical trial of eflornithine (n=26 subjects) and a prospective, randomized, placebocontrolled phase 2 clinical trial of eflornithine (n=40 subjects). setting: ambulatory academic tertiary care referral center. participants: sixty-six volunteer subjects who had previously treated bladder, prostate, or colon cancer with no current evidence of neoplastic disease, or who were healthy individuals at increased risk for colon cancer, all without need of hearing amplification. interventions: subjects were randomized to receive oral eflornithine at daily doses between 0.5 and 3 g per square meter of body surface area (g/m2) for 6 to 12 months (phase 1 study) or randomized to receive placebo or eflornithine, 0.5 g/m2 for 12 months (phase 2 study). outcome measures: auditory thresholds were measured before, during, and after eflornithine administration. auditory thresholds and threshold shifts were evaluated with regard to eflornithine dose, serologic variables, and demographic factors. results: predictable shifts in auditory thresholds occurred following administration of eflornithine. as the daily dose of eflornithine increased, the magnitude and incidence of threshold shift increased, and the time until onset of threshold shift decreased. threshold changes were greater in the lower frequencies than in the higher frequencies. subjects' sex, age, and renal function had no effect on eflornithineassociated

"pseudomonas aeruginosa adherence to external auditory canal epithelium. background: pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important causative agent for external otitis. the specific bacterium-host reaction has not been investigated. it is therefore unknown whether adhesion of the external otitis strain to the external auditory canal epithelium is increased compared with strains isolated from other infections. design: a cohort study was designed to outline adhesion of p aeruginosa to the external auditory canal epithelium, cultured in vitro, of the guinea pig. factors important for pathogenesis were also studied. patients: pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from nonhospitalized patients were collected consecutively at the bacteriological laboratories at karolinska hospital, stockholm, and huddinge hospital, huddinge, sweden. external otitis strains were compared with strains from leg ulcers, urinary tract infections, and cystic fibrosis. methods: adhesion to the external auditory canal epithelium cultured in vitro was measured and compared groupwise with the mean profile of pathogenic factors. results: adhesion to the epithelium was significantly increased for external otitis strains. these strains also had a significantly increased deoxyribonuclease production and a significantly decreased production of pyocyanin and alginate. conclusions: the significantly increased ability of p aeruginosa, isolated from external otitis, to adhere to external auditory canal epithelium was combined with a significant production of pathogenic factors. the p aeruginosa that causes

"safety of in vivo adenovirus-mediated thymidine kinase treatment of oral cancer. background: adenovirus-mediated transfer of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (tk) is one of the most effective gene therapy strategies for solid tumors in experimental animal studies. foundational animal studies in an oral cancer model have demonstrated significant antitumor effects and improved animal survival using this treatment strategy. objective: to assess the safety of adenovirusmediated transfer of the herpes simplex virus tk gene for the treatment of oral cancer. design: oral tumors were established in c3h/hej mice and were treated with tk followed by systemic ganciclovir administration. polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques were used to screen local surrounding tissues and distant organs for the presence of the adenoviral construct. microscopic examination of the tissues was performed to determine the cytopathic effects of the vector. blood samples were obtained from the animals to test for liver, renal, and bone marrow function after treatment. results: the adenoviral vector was present in the livers, lungs, and kidneys of animals treated with the maximal single injection dose of 2℅109 plaque forming units (pfu). no vector was noted systemically after delivery of an equally effective low dose of 1℅108 pfu. microscopic examination revealed no cytopathic effects in distant organs despite the presence of vector. results of liver and renal function tests revealed no differences between treated and control animals. there was no statistical difference in white blood cell count, hematocrit, or platelet count between animals treated with ganciclovir and control animals. conclusions: based on these results, the direct delivery of

"mandibular fracture and associated cervical spine fracture, a rare and predictable injury: protocol for cervical spine evaluation and review of 1382 cases. objectives: to assess the relationship and incidence of cervical spine injuries in patients with mandibular fractures and to recommend an organized approach to cervical spine evaluation in these patients. design: a retrospective review of medical records of all patients with mandibular fractures at a level i trauma hospital from 1984 through 1993. patient demographics, injury, mechanism of injury, associated symptoms, physical presentation, and adjuvant radiographic evaluations were recorded. setting: level i,1000-bed, urban trauma center in atlanta, ga. results: a total of 1382 patients with mandibular fractures were examined during the 10-year period of review. cervical spine radiographs were obtained on 501 (36.3%) of these patients. from these radiographs, only 8 cervical spine fractures were found. all of the patients with cervical spine injuries (n=8) had other associated maxillofacial injuries (n=4), were involved in a motor vehicle accident (n=7), or sustained gunshot wounds (n=1). conclusions: judicious use of cervical spine radiographs in the appropriate setting of mandibular trauma is beneficial. however, clinical criteria should dictate rational use of radiographs, since the association between cervical spine injuries and mandibular trauma is rare and predictable.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1304-1307",mandibular fracture;;cervical spine injuries;;mandibular fractures;;cervical spine evaluation;;cervical spine fracture;;cervical spine radiographs;;mandibular trauma;;radiographs;;cervical spine evaluation and review;;rare and predictable injury;;level i trauma hospital;;relationship and incidence;;adjuvant radiographic evaluations;;motor vehicle accident;;cervical spine fractures;;predictable injury,"mandibular fracture and associated cervical spine fracture, a rare and predictable injury: protocol for cervical spine evaluation and review of 1382 cases.;;objectives: to assess the relationship and incidence of cervical spine injuries in patients with mandibular fractures and to recommend an organized approach to cervical spine evaluation in these patients.;;design: a retrospective review of medical records of all patients with mandibular fractures at a level i trauma hospital from 1984 through 1993. patient demographics, injury, mechanism of injury, associated symptoms, physical presentation, and adjuvant radiographic evaluations were recorded.;;setting: level i,1000-bed, urban trauma center in atlanta, ga. results: a total of 1382 patients with mandibular fractures were examined during the 10-year period of review.;;cervical spine radiographs were obtained on 501 (36.3%) of these patients.;;from these radiographs, only 8 cervical spine fractures were found.;;all of the patients with cervical spine injuries (n=8) had other associated maxillofacial injuries (n=4), were involved in a motor vehicle accident (n=7), or sustained gunshot wounds (n=1).;;conclusions: judicious use of cervical spine radiographs in the appropriate setting of mandibular trauma is beneficial.;;however, clinical criteria should dictate rational use of radiographs, since the association between cervical spine injuries and mandibular trauma is rare and predictable.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:1304-1307",mandibular trauma;;protocol;;cervical spine evaluation;;cervical spine radiographs;;judicious use;;predictable injury;;assess;;appropriate;;design;;maxillofacial injuries;;motor vehicle accident;;total;;atlanta;;predictable.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;ga. results;;gunshot wounds;;conclusions;;organized approach;;review;;patient demographics;;retrospective review;;mechanism;;symptoms;;cervical spine fractures;;physical presentation;;injury;;medical records;;adjuvant radiographic evaluations;;relationship;;urban trauma center;;incidence;;clinical criteria;;mandibular fractures;;cases;;association;;cervical spine fracture;;rare;;level;;radiographs;;10-year period;;rational use;;mandibular fracture;;patients;;cervical spine injuries;;objectives
"the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line in malar reduction: a cadaver study. objective: to demonstrate the persistent malar displacement and distraction of the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line that is possible after alignment of the frontozygomatic and infraorbital rim fractures of a displaced malar fracture. design: nonblinded cadaver study. subjects: three fresh cadaver heads and 1 representative clinical example. intervention: the cadaver heads were subjected to blunt trauma to the malar eminence. reduction of the malar unit was performed either with attention to the frontozygomatic and infraorbital rim fractures alone or with concomitant inspection of the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line. the representative case was repaired with a transconjunctival approach for inspection of the zygomaticsphenoid fracture line. results: persistent malar asymmetry is possible after the reduction of displaced malar fractures when only the frontozygomatic and infraorbital rim buttresses are used for reference. in each case in our study, the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line remained distracted. alignment of the zygomaticsphenoid fracture restored premorbid malar position. conclusion: inspection of the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line can contribute significantly to the precise 3-dimensional reduction of displaced malar fractures.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1308-1311",zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line;;displaced malar fracture;;malar fracture;;frontozygomatic and infraorbital rim fractures;;infraorbital rim fractures;;displaced malar fractures;;cadaver study;;cadaver heads;;zygomaticsphenoid fracture;;malar fractures;;representative clinical example;;three fresh cadaver heads;;persistent malar displacement;;premorbid malar position;;persistent malar asymmetry;;fresh cadaver heads;;nonblinded cadaver study;;infraorbital rim buttresses,"the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line in malar reduction: a cadaver study.;;objective: to demonstrate the persistent malar displacement and distraction of the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line that is possible after alignment of the frontozygomatic and infraorbital rim fractures of a displaced malar fracture.;;design: nonblinded cadaver study.;;subjects: three fresh cadaver heads and 1 representative clinical example.;;intervention: the cadaver heads were subjected to blunt trauma to the malar eminence.;;reduction of the malar unit was performed either with attention to the frontozygomatic and infraorbital rim fractures alone or with concomitant inspection of the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line.;;the representative case was repaired with a transconjunctival approach for inspection of the zygomaticsphenoid fracture line.;;results: persistent malar asymmetry is possible after the reduction of displaced malar fractures when only the frontozygomatic and infraorbital rim buttresses are used for reference.;;in each case in our study, the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line remained distracted.;;alignment of the zygomaticsphenoid fracture restored premorbid malar position.;;conclusion: inspection of the zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line can contribute significantly to the precise 3-dimensional reduction of displaced malar fractures.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:1308-1311",persistent malar displacement;;reference;;representative clinical example;;cadaver study;;premorbid malar position;;results;;malar unit;;design;;representative case;;alignment;;intervention;;malar reduction;;reduction;;subjects;;trauma;;objective;;persistent malar asymmetry;;fresh cadaver heads;;conclusion;;zygomatic-sphenoid fracture line;;case;;attention;;malar eminence;;infraorbital rim buttresses;;distraction;;transconjunctival approach;;malar fracture;;zygomaticsphenoid fracture;;zygomaticsphenoid fracture line;;study;;precise 3-dimensional reduction;;concomitant inspection;;malar fractures.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;cadaver heads;;infraorbital rim fractures;;inspection;;malar fractures

retrospective review. setting: tertiary cancer facility. patients: we evaluated 115 consecutive patients undergoing craniofacial resection for malignant neoplasms involving the anterior skull base. forty-five (39%) presented with recurrent or persistent disease after prior therapy. main outcome measures: survival was evaluated with the kaplan-meier product limit method and comparisons between

"versatility of the free anterolateral thigh flap for reconstruction of head and neck defects. objective: the anterolateral thigh flap has many advantages in head and neck reconstruction. however, it has not yet come into widespread use because of the anatomic variations of its perforators. herein, we describe a safe operative technique related to the patterns of the perforators and discuss its wide versatility. setting: a national cancer center hospital. patients: thirty-eight anterolateral thigh flaps were transferred. confirmation and dissection of the flap pedicle were simultaneously performed with tumor resection. the design and elevation of the flap were carried out immediately after the tumor resection was completed. results: from the study of the anatomic variations of the perforators, septocutaneous patterns were recognized in 10 cases (26.3%) and musculocutaneous patterns in 28 cases (73.7%). all flaps were easily and safely elevated with our techniques. thirty-six flaps survived. partial necrosis was noted owing to excessive thinning procedure in one patient and total necrosis was noted owing to venous thrombosis at the anastomosis part in another patient. conclusions: we found that the anterolateral thigh flap has numerous advantages. it is possible to perform the flap elevation and the tumor resection simultaneously. the flap is generally thin and is suitable for reconstruction of intraoral defects. combined flaps with neighboring tissues and other, distant flaps can be used. furthermore, since our technique minimizes the problems of confirmation and dissection of the perforators, we conclude that this flap can be successfully used to repair a variety of large defects of the head and neck.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1325-1331","anterolateral thigh flap;;tumor resection;;confirmation and dissection;;perforators;;anatomic variations;;flaps;;free anterolateral thigh flap;;perforators , septocutaneous patterns;;thirty-eight anterolateral thigh flaps;;safe operative technique;;excessive thinning procedure;;design and elevation;;neck reconstruction;;neck defects","versatility of the free anterolateral thigh flap for reconstruction of head and neck defects.;;objective: the anterolateral thigh flap has many advantages in head and neck reconstruction.;;however, it has not yet come into widespread use because of the anatomic variations of its perforators.;;herein, we describe a safe operative technique related to the patterns of the perforators and discuss its wide versatility.;;setting: a national cancer center hospital.;;patients: thirty-eight anterolateral thigh flaps were transferred.;;confirmation and dissection of the flap pedicle were simultaneously performed with tumor resection.;;the design and elevation of the flap were carried out immediately after the tumor resection was completed.;;results: from the study of the anatomic variations of the perforators, septocutaneous patterns were recognized in 10 cases (26.3%) and musculocutaneous patterns in 28 cases (73.7%).;;all flaps were easily and safely elevated with our techniques.;;thirty-six flaps survived.;;partial necrosis was noted owing to excessive thinning procedure in one patient and total necrosis was noted owing to venous thrombosis at the anastomosis part in another patient.;;conclusions: we found that the anterolateral thigh flap has numerous advantages.;;it is possible to perform the flap elevation and the tumor resection simultaneously.;;the flap is generally thin and is suitable for reconstruction of intraoral defects.;;combined flaps with neighboring tissues and other, distant flaps can be used.;;furthermore, since our technique minimizes the problems of confirmation and dissection of the perforators, we conclude that this flap can be successfully used to repair a variety of large defects of the head and neck.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:1325-1331",safe operative technique;;neck.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;many advantages;;flap elevation;;tissues;;herein;;free anterolateral thigh flap;;design;;numerous advantages;;patient;;anastomosis part;;techniques;;total necrosis;;conclusions;;perform;;large defects;;anatomic variations;;reconstruction;;objective;;tumor resection;;musculocutaneous patterns;;discuss;;widespread use;;head;;confirmation;;elevation;;flap;;neck reconstruction;;problems;;national cancer center hospital;;dissection;;results;;technique minimizes;;distant flaps;;neck defects;;venous thrombosis;;septocutaneous patterns;;thinning procedure;;thirty-eight anterolateral thigh flaps;;cases;;versatility;;partial necrosis;;study;;variety;;wide versatility;;patterns;;patients;;intraoral defects;;flaps;;perforators;;anterolateral thigh flap;;flap pedicle

"maxillary sinus mucosal blood flow during nasal vs tracheal respiration. objective: to determine the effect of changes from nasal to tracheal respiration on maxillary sinus mucosal blood flow in rabbits with unobstructed sinus ostia. design: animals underwent tracheotomy with a t tube, and then a small window of intact maxillary sinus mucosa was exposed. mucosal blood flow was recorded during normal nasal respiration using laser-doppler velocimetry. at hourly intervals, respiration was changed from the nasal to the tracheal route and then back again. subjects: ten anesthetized rabbits were used: 5 underwent single and 4 underwent multiple shifts in the respiratory route, while 1 was monitored continuously during long-term nasal breathing only. results: a significant decrease in maxillary sinus blood flow occurred on switching from nasal to tracheal respiration and a significant increase in blood flow occurred on return to nasal respiration. where multiple switches were made, blood flow changes diminished in magnitude, but significant decreases (nasal to tracheal) or increases (tracheal to nasal) were evident in all cases. conclusions: it is proposed that the maxillary sinus may act in an accessory capacity to the nose for humidification of inspired air via secretions liberated from the sinus ostium. furthermore, we suggest that nasal airflow is involved with the reflex regulation of sinus blood flow, probably via stimulation of sensory receptors in the nasal cavity. reduced maxillary sinus mucosal blood flow may thus contribute to supra-systemic levels of antral carbon dioxide. since elevated carbon dioxide levels have been shown to reduce maxillary sinus mucociliary activity in vitro, nasal airflow compromise may contribute to the initiation of a cascade of pathophysiological events leading to acute sinusitis.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1336-1340",blood flow;;maxillary sinus;;mucosal blood flow;;maxillary sinus mucosal blood

"detection of cervical metastasis: a meta-analysis comparing computed tomography with physical examination. background: despite extensive coverage in recent literature, controversy continues with regard to the relative sensitivities of computed tomography (ct) and physical examination (pe). objective: to identify a statistically significant consensus. data sources: initially, data were reviewed on 47 consecutive patients with head and neck cancer on whom a total of 53 neck dissections were performed. these data were combined with findings from a 15-year medline review of the english-language literature, including references. study selection: all publications that contained a direct comparison of ct with pe, with appropriate data availability, were included. data extraction: multiple-observer independent extraction was used. a total of 647 neck dissections were included in the meta-analysis. the definition of metastasis varied minimally among studies as follows: (1) nodal size, greater than 10 to 15 mm; (2) multiplicity of 8- to 10-mm nodes; or (3) evidence of necrosis. necks were compared for positivity or negativity rather than for the actual nodal staging. in all cases, a final determination was made by results of histopathologic examination of surgical specimens. data syntheses: the results in this review favored ct over pe but were not statistically significant by use of the fisher exact test. a combination of the present study's data with those of the literature review yielded the following meta-analysis results: sensitivity, 83% (ct) vs 74% (pe) (p=.002);

"osteogenic sarcoma of the jaw: a clinicopathologic review of 12 patients. objective: to review our experience with osteogenic sarcoma of the jaw. data source: the pathology and clinical files of the mount sinai medical center, new york, ny, were examined. study selection: for the past 6 years, 12 pathologically documented cases were identified. data extraction: surgical resection margins, histological tumor grade and subtype, and treatment modality were reexamined with regard to effect on outcome. data synthesis: the mean age of occurrence was 32.6 years, ranging from 12 to 60 years. male predominance was noted in both mandibular and maxillary tumors. local recurrence occurred in 6 of 12 patients after 3 months to 5 years; 4 of these patients have either persistant disease or died of disease. in this recurrence group, only 2 patients remain disease free 7 and 12 years after initial diagnosis and 6.5 and 8 years after recurrence. conclusions: this study is too small to draw statistically significant conclusions. however, the longest survivor in the group (disease free at 12 years) had a histologically low-grade mandibular tumor. we reiterate the findings in the literature, which agree that osteogenic sarcoma of the jaw is an aggressive disease. patient prognosis may depend on the tumor grade and size on presentation, as well as the completeness of initial surgery as monitored by resection margins.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:169-174",osteogenic sarcoma;;tumor grade;;resection margins;;histological tumor grade and subtype;;tumor grade and size;;histologically low-grade mandibular tumor;;pathologically documented cases;;mandibular and maxillary tumors;;pathology and clinical files;;jaw;;histological tumor grade;;surgical resection margins;;statistically significant conclusions;;low-grade mandibular tumor,"osteogenic sarcoma of the jaw: a clinicopathologic review of 12 patients.;;objective: to review our experience with osteogenic sarcoma of the jaw.;;data source: the pathology and clinical files of the mount sinai medical center, new york, ny, were examined.;;study selection: for the past 6 years, 12 pathologically documented cases were identified.;;data extraction: surgical resection margins, histological tumor grade and subtype, and treatment modality were reexamined with regard to effect on outcome.;;data synthesis: the mean age of occurrence was 32.6 years, ranging from 12 to 60 years.;;male predominance was noted in both mandibular and maxillary tumors.;;local recurrence occurred in 6 of 12 patients after 3 months to 5 years; 4 of these patients have either persistant disease or died of disease.;;in this recurrence group, only 2 patients remain disease free 7 and 12 years after initial diagnosis and 6.5 and 8 years after recurrence.;;conclusions: this study is too small to draw statistically significant conclusions.;;however, the longest survivor in the group (disease free at 12 years) had a histologically low-grade mandibular tumor.;;we reiterate the findings in the literature, which agree that osteogenic sarcoma of the jaw is an aggressive disease.;;patient prognosis may depend on the tumor grade and size on presentation, as well as the completeness of initial surgery as monitored by resection margins.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:169-174",occurrence;;findings;;longest survivor;;study selection;;years;;pathology;;histological tumor grade;;size;;recurrence;;group;;patient prognosis;;local recurrence;;jaw;;initial diagnosis;;recurrence group;;clinical files;;ny;;new york;;objective;;completeness;;presentation;;tumor grade;;osteogenic sarcoma;;literature;;aggressive disease;;surgical resection margins;;significant conclusions;;regard;;male predominance;;low-grade mandibular tumor;;cases;;data;;treatment modality;;mean age;;persistant disease;;conclusions;;study;;months;;data extraction;;disease;;experience;;subtype;;patients;;maxillary tumors;;clinicopathologic review;;outcome;;resection margins.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;initial surgery;;mount sinai medical center
"stapedectomy vs stapedotomy: do you really need a laser?. objective: to compare the effectiveness of different techniques of stapes surgery in improving the hearing of individuals with otosclerosis. methods and design: large and small fenestra techniques, as well as the instrument used to make the fenestra (drill or laser), were compared with regard to effectiveness and rate of side effects. the charts of 875 patients who underwent primary stapedectomies performed by members of the house ear clinic, los angeles, calif, were reviewed. patients who underwent stapedectomy for reasons other than otosclerosis and those with inadequate postoperative bone conduction threshold data were excluded. a group of 550 patients met the criteria. this group was broken into categories depending on the technique of stapedectomy and the instrument used to create the fenestra. the techniques were then compared using air-bone gap closure at different frequencies, pure tone average, and the rate of significant side effects. results: the study indicated that small fenestra stapedotomy and large fenestra techniques have similar rates of closure of the air-bone gap. small fenestra stapedotomy has a slightly lower rate of postoperative sensorineural hearing loss, especially at higher frequencies. with regard to the small fenestra technique, there was no significant difference in either postoperative airbone gap closure or postoperative sensorineural hearing loss, regardless of whether the fenestra was created by laser or microdrill. conclusions: while we did find a statistically significant difference between the large and small fenestra techniques in postoperative sensorineural hearing loss at higher frequency, the difference is small and is probably not clinically significant. therefore, we find that similar good results can be obtained by the experienced surgeon using either the large or small fenestra technique. similarly, we found the laser and microdrill to

"speech perception skills and speech production intelligibility in french children with prelingual deafness and cochlear implants. objective: to examine speech perception and production intelligibility in french children with prelingual deafness who received multichannel cochlear implants. design: within-subject, repeated-measures design for assessing speech perception and a cross-sectional design for assessing overall speech intelligibility. setting: a pediatric cochlear implant center. subjects: sixty-four french children with prelingual deafness who received multichannel cochlear implants (mean age at time of implantation, 3 years 11 months) underwent assessment for speech perception. a subset of 16 children who received implants by 3 years of age underwent assessment for speech intelligibility. main outcome measures: speech perception skills were assessed using phoneme detection, closed-set word and sentence recognition, and modified open-set (mos) recognition. speech intelligibility was assessed by asking 50 listeners to identify recorded speech samples from the subjects. dependent variables for the studies consisted of percent of correct items. results: after implantation, all children were able to detect phonemes by 3 months. closed-set word and sentence identification reached 100% accuracy by 48 months (7 children with 4 years of implantation experience). some children (8 of 48) demonstrated some mos recognition after 1 year. modified open-set recognition averaged 67.9% by 42 months (12 children available) and 80% by 48 months (7 children available). overall speech intelligibility was 4.2% after 1 year, 30.7% after 2 years, 55.2% after 3 years, and 74.2% after 4 years. within-subject comparisons of mos recognition and overall speech intelligibility scores revealed an insignificant trend for high perceptual performance to be associated with higher speech intelligibility scores (p=.17). there also was a tendency for higher performance to be associated with longer implantation experience. conclusions: speech perception scores appear to increase with increased experience using a cochlear implant. overall speech

complained of nasal and sinus-related symptoms and underwent ct examinations, 130 were found to have unilateral sinonasal abnormalities without detectable changes in the bone structure. results: accurate preoperative diagnoses were made using ct in 75% of the patients with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps and 85% of the patients with mucoceles. in the remaining patients, preoperative diagnoses for both diseases were made using mri. all fungal and vascular diseases were accurately diagnosed using mri alone. although neither ct nor mri were useful in the qualitative diagnosis of neoplasm, the presence of neoplastic conditions, except papilloma, was indicated by mri. using endonasal endoscopy, biopsy was an accurate diagnostic tool, with minimal tissue damage, in

"antioxidant levels in the nasal mucosa of patients with chronic sinusitis and healthy controls. background: imbalances between oxidant formation and antioxidative defense are associated with the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory disorders of the respiratory tract. therefore, a role of oxidative stress in chronic upper airway tract infections can be anticipated. objective: to determine if patients with chronic sinusitis demonstrate a reduced antioxidative tissue status. design: the levels of 3 biologically important antioxidants, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione, uric acid, and vitamin e, were determined biochemically in mucosal biopsy specimens from the uncinate process of patients with chronic sinusitis and healthy controls. subjects: inflamed mucosa samples were obtained from 9 patients with chronic sinusitis during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. normal mucosa samples were collected from 10 healthy controls during surgery for nasal obstruction. results: the data (presented as mean㊣sd) show a significant reduction (p≒.05) of reduced glutathione levels (0.3㊣0.1 米mol/g wet weight) and uric acid levels (2.7㊣0.4 米mol/g wet weight) in mucosa samples obtained from patients with chronic sinusitis compared with healthy controls (0.6㊣0.2 and 3.4㊣0.6 米mol/g wet weight, respectively). no difference was found in oxidized glutathione (24㊣8

"ideal timing of pediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction. objective: to determine whether there is an ideal age at which to perform a laryngotracheal reconstruction (ltr) in the pediatric population. design: prospective observational study. setting: tertiary care children's hospital. patients: forty-eight patients aged 48 months or younger with laryngotracheal stenosis who underwent 50 ltrs from october 1, 1986, to june 30, 1995. patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1, aged 8 through 24 months (22 patients); group 2, aged 25 through 48 months (26 patients). intervention: endoscopy and ltr. main outcome measures: successful decannulation. results: statistical analysis showed that (1) patients in group 2 had more severe degree of laryngotracheal stenosis as determined by duration of stenting with no difference in multiple sites of stenosis or type of repair required to correct laryngotracheal stenosis and (2) patients in group 2 were more likely to have successful decannulation. conclusion: laryngotracheal reconstruction at a younger age (<25 months) is important for a child's speech and language development as well as for eliminating the morbidity and mortality associated with a tracheotomy. however, ltr at a younger age is associated with a higher risk of failure despite lesser degree of pathology. therefore, although we still recommend ltr at a younger age since it may be beneficial for a child's speech and language development and avoidance of tracheotomy complications, this recommendation may be at the price of ltr failure and requirement for revision procedures.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:206-208",laryngotracheal reconstruction;;younger age;;laryngotracheal stenosis;;ltr;;child's speech and language development;;successful decannulation;;language development;;tertiary care children's hospital;;ltr failure and requirement;;pediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction;;endoscopy and ltr;;morbidity and mortality;;main outcome measures;;prospective observational study;;ideal timing;;ideal age;;pediatric population,"ideal timing of pediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction.;;objective: to determine whether there is an ideal age at which to perform a laryngotracheal reconstruction (ltr) in the pediatric population.;;design: prospective observational study.;;setting: tertiary care children's hospital.;;patients: forty-eight patients aged 48 months or younger with laryngotracheal stenosis who underwent 50 ltrs from october 1, 1986, to june 30, 1995. patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1, aged 8 through 24 months (22 patients); group 2, aged 25 through 48 months (26 patients).;;intervention: endoscopy and ltr.;;main outcome measures: successful decannulation.;;results: statistical analysis showed that (1) patients in group 2 had more severe degree of laryngotracheal stenosis as determined by duration of stenting with no difference in multiple sites of stenosis or type of repair required to correct laryngotracheal stenosis and (2) patients in group 2 were more likely to have successful decannulation.;;conclusion: laryngotracheal reconstruction at a younger age (<25 months) is important for a child's speech and language development as well as for eliminating the morbidity and mortality associated with a tracheotomy.;;however, ltr at a younger age is associated with a higher risk of failure despite lesser degree of pathology.;;therefore, although we still recommend ltr at a younger age since it may be beneficial for a child's speech and language development and avoidance of tracheotomy complications, this recommendation may be at the price of ltr failure and requirement for revision procedures.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:206-208",repair;;requirement;;endoscopy;;underwent;;multiple sites;;child;;results;;lesser degree;;duration;;tracheotomy complications;;design;;statistical analysis;;eliminating;;recommendation;;laryngotracheal reconstruction;;pathology;;intervention;;group;;younger age;;higher risk;;ideal age;;pediatric population;;ideal;;speech;;laryngotracheal stenosis;;stenosis;;main;;type;;mortality;;conclusion;;more severe degree;;ltr failure;;forty-eight patients;;price;;measures;;ltrs;;revision procedures.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;groups;;successful decannulation;;difference;;morbidity;;tertiary care children;;ltr;;october;;failure;;months;;patients;;objective;;tracheotomy;;pediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction;;language development;;avoidance;;prospective observational study
"tubeless spontaneous respiration technique for pediatric microlaryngeal surgery. background: tubeless spontaneous respiration technique for pediatric microlaryngeal surgery may be accomplished using different anesthetic protocols. two methods, inhalation of volatile anesthetic agents alone and in combination with intravenous propofol, are reviewed with regard to intraoperative airway stability, post-operative morbidity, recovery room course, and halothane concentration required during maintenance anesthesia. design: retrospective case series. setting: otolaryngology referral hospital. patients and methods: twenty-nine microlaryngeal procedures were performed using tubeless spontaneous respiration technique in children ranging from 2 weeks to 11 years of age. the following 2 anesthetic protocols were used: inhaled volatile anesthetic agents alone in 18 procedures and in combination with intravenous propofol in 11. anesthesia, surgery, and recovery room times were documented. specific characteristics of anesthetic maintenance, including total anesthetic gas flow (liters per minute), variations of halothane concentration (percentage), and duration of halothane administration (minutes) were also recorded to calculate the mean concentration of halothane (percentage) delivered to each patient. results: no statistical differences were observed between the 2 protocols in terms of anesthesia and surgical outcomes. adjusting for differences in patient age, weight, maintenance duration, and total anesthetic gas flow, the introduction of propofol allowed a statistically significant reduction in the mean concentration of halothane required during maintenance anesthesia. conclusions: both tubeless spontaneous respiration technique protocols proved successful in this study. however, the addition of propofol allowed a significant reduction in the halothane requirement during anesthesia maintenance. this has the potential benefit of decreasing the

"uvulopalatopharyngoplasty vs laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty: anatomical considerations. objective: to assess and compare anatomical changes in the velopharynx produced by conventional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and by laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty. design: a before-after trial of patients who underwent conventional or laser-assisted palatal surgical procedures. patients and interventions: a total of 174 patients (157 men and 17 women; age range, 22-71 years; mean age, 48 years) who were suffering from heavy snoring (n=16) or obstructive sleep apnea. the first 100 consecutive patients underwent conventional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and the remaining 74 underwent 1 of 2 surgical variations of laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty. main outcome measures: preoperative and postoperative examinations included peroral photographs of the oropharynx and nasopharyngoscopic examination of the velopharyngeal valve. in 10 randomly selected patients, postoperative lateral and frontal cephalometric radiographs, enhanced with contrast media, were compared with routine preoperative radiographs. results: uvulopalatopharyngoplasty results in an enlargement of the oropharynx and an increased velopharyngeal air space. laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, by producing a raw surface, involves circumferential scarring, the severity of which depends on the velopharyngeal axial configuration; therefore, it can result in a diminished velopharyngeal air space and decreased distensibility. conclusions: from an anatomical viewpoint, laser-assisted surgery of the palate is significantly inferior to conventional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and may even be deleterious. the results of preoperative and postoperative polysomnographic comparisons in patients who undergo laser-assisted operations should be evaluated to determine whether future laser-assisted surgery is an adequate option, even for snoring as an isolated symptom.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:265-276",laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty;;conventional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty;;uvulopalatopharyngoplasty;;velopharyngeal air space;;laser-assisted surgery;;preoperative and postoperative polysomnographic comparisons;;uvulopalatopharyngoplasty vs laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty;;first 100 consecutive patients;;increased velopharyngeal air space;;oropharynx and nasopharyngoscopic examination;;laser-assisted palatal surgical procedures;;diminished velopharyngeal air space;;preoperative and postoperative examinations;;randomly selected patients;;surgical variations;;frontal cephalometric radiographs;;obstructive sleep apnea;;main outcome measures;;routine preoperative radiographs,"uvulopalatopharyngoplasty vs laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty: anatomical considerations.;;objective: to assess and compare anatomical changes in the velopharynx produced by conventional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and by laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty.;;design: a before-after trial of patients who underwent conventional or laser-assisted palatal surgical procedures.;;patients and interventions: a total of 174 patients (157 men and 17 women;

"sinonasal melanoma: a clinicopathologic study of 25 cases and literature meta-analysis. objectives: to report on 25 cases of sinonasal melanoma at our institution during 1977 to 1995 and to perform a literature meta-analysis on sinonasal melanoma and study survival statistics. data sources: a retrospective search of pathology and clinical records at our institution to identify patients with sinonasal melanoma; a retrospective search of the englishlanguage literature for cases of documented sinonasal melanoma. study selection: cases from our institution were included if there was adequate pathologic material confirming the pathologic diagnosis. for the meta-analysis, cases were accepted if they included convincing histologic illustrations or documentation of melanin by fontana-masson staining or ultrastructural examination or had an acceptable immunohistochemical profile with some documented clinical follow-up on individual patients. data extraction: the following parameters were monitored for patients from our institution: age, sex, possible exposure histories, tumor site, tumor size, type of therapy, clinical outcome, cytochemistry (fontana-masson stain), and immunohistochemical profile (s-100, hmb-45, vimentin, cytokeratin). the parameters of the metaanalysis were age, sex, tumor site, and survival data. data synthesis: our patient population included 10 men and 15 women aged 23 to 83 years (mean, 65 years). tumor sites included inferior turbinate, superior nasal cavity, nasal cavity floor/palate, ethmoid sinuses, and maxillary sinus. the immunohistochemical profile was as follows (positive cases): s-100 (14 of 14), hmb-45 (12 of 14), vimentin (9 of 10), cytokeratin (0 of 9). melanin was demonstrated by fontana-masson stain (8 of 8 cases). follow-up information was available in 25 cases, with follow-up ranging from 1 to 217 months (mean, 39 months). eleven patients were disease free at 1 to 217 months (mean, 59 months) after excision. local single recurrences developed in 6 patients at 3 to 84 months (mean, 14 months), and were treated with surgery. multiple local recurrences were seen in 2 patients. one of them died of disseminated disease, after 2 local recurrences, 60 months after original diagnosis. the other was disease free after 38 months. ten patients ultimately died of disease within 2 to 60 months after diagnosis (mean, 21 months). only 2 patients may have developed metastatic disease in the absence of local recurrence. a total of 163 cases were identified from the literature: 53 women, 54 men (56 gender unknown). stratification by era (pre-1980 vs post-1980) did not reveal any gender differences (pre-1980: 34 women [48%], 37 men [52%]; post-1980: 34 women [55%], 27 men [44%]). however, stratification by era did reveal an age shift toward older patients in the 1980-1995 era. the 5-year median survival for all patients was 36 months. stratification by era of treatment revealed a long-term survival trend: patients treated before 1980 had somewhat better survival at 60 and 100 months (40% and 36%, respectively) than patients diagnosed and treated between 1980 and 1995 (30% and 23%, respectively), although statistical significance was not reached. conclusion: it is unclear why the long-term survival for patients with sinonasal melanoma seems to be decreasing. despite advances in imaging techniques, which would potentially allow for earlier tumor discovery, and advances in surgical techniques and adjuvant therapeutics, the mean survival for patients with sinonasal melanoma has not improved during the past 15 years.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:290-296",sinonasal melanoma;;immunohistochemical profile;;tumor site;;local recurrence;;fontana-masson stain;;literature meta-analysis;;long-term survival;;local recurrences;;retrospective search;;convincing histologic illustrations or documentation;;fontana-masson staining or ultrastructural examination;;nasal cavity floor palate;;stratification,"sinonasal melanoma: a clinicopathologic study of 25 cases and literature meta-analysis.;;objectives: to report on 25 cases of sinonasal melanoma at our institution during 1977 to 1995 and to perform a literature meta-analysis on sinonasal melanoma and study survival statistics.;;data sources: a retrospective search of pathology and clinical records at our institution to identify patients with sinonasal melanoma;

"selective laryngeal reinnervation with separate phrenic and ansa cervicalis nerve transfers. objective: to perform selective reinnervation of the laryngeal abductor and adductor muscle groups after injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, recovering laryngeal function without impairment by synkinesis. design: ten cats underwent the surgical procedure. to reinnervate the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (abductor), a phrenic nerve graft was anastomosed to the main trunk of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. the adductor branch was severed, and the proximal stump was buried in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. the sternohyoid branch of the ansa cervicalis was anastomosed to the distal stump to reinnervate the adductor muscle group. after a period of 10 weeks, the laryngeal function was evaluated with videolaryngoscopy and electromyography of the posterior cricoarytenoid and vocalis muscles. results: of the 10 cats, 9 could be evaluated. laryngeal abductor function was comparable with the unaffected side in the 9 cats. during respiratory distress conditions, a minor compromise of the maximal abduction was observed in 5 cats. phonation was not tested, but spontaneous adduction during expiration was seen in all cats. reflex closure on ipsilateral, supraglottic, tactile mucosal stimulation was seen in only 2 cats. in each cat, evidence of nerve regeneration and reinnervation of both muscle groups was established with electromyography, electrical stimulation, and histological examination. conclusions: using this selective reinnervation procedure, good laryngeal function can be achieved in the cat model, which may be applicable in humans. by reinnervation of the vocalis muscle, muscle tonus is achieved, which is expected to improve voice quality. using this procedure, however, no active reflex closure may be expected.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:406-411",laryngeal function;;posterior cricoarytenoid;;reinnervation;;recurrent laryngeal nerve;;adductor

"markers for assessment of nodal metastasis in laryngeal carcinoma. background: regional metastasis is an important factor in the treatment and prognosis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. although in recent years imaging techniques have improved, it is still impossible to detect small metastatic deposits. metastasis is mainly determined by properties of the primary tumor and its interaction with surrounding structures. objective: to identify markers that predict the presence of metastasis based on the features of the primary tumor. design: correlation of the results of histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular biological analysis with clinical and histopathological data. materials and methods: several histological features and biological markers were examined in 31 laryngeal carcinomas. the following markers were selected on their putative role in the process of metastasis and were studied using immunohistochemical and/or southern blot techniques: proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna),p53, retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene (rb), myc, bcl-2 (inhibitor of apoptosis), epidermal growth factor (egf), egf-receptor (egfr), neu, nm23 (also known as nme1, putative metastasis suppressor), desmoplakin, neuron cell-adhesion molecule (n-cam), epithelial cell-adhesion molecule (ep-cam), e-cadherin, cyclin d1 (ccnd1), and ems1. results: the presence of an inflammatory reaction surrounding the tumor (p=.07), eosinophilic infiltration (p=.16), positive immunostaining for rb (p=.02), negative immunostaining for ep-cam (p=.13), and amplification of ccnd1 and ems1 (p=.05) correlated with nodal metastasis. the combination of an inflammatory reaction, eosinophilic infiltration, and staining for rb and ep-cam resulted in a superior accuracy in assessing nodal metastasis. conclusions: these results indicate that it is possible to predict and exclude lymph node metastasis by studying the features of the primary tumor only. when these results are confirmed in a larger series, biological markers may be powerful diagnostic tools with great impact on clinical decision making.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:412-419","nodal

"surgical salvage after radiotherapy for advanced laryngopharyngeal carcinoma. objective: to comment on the use of surgery after the failure of radiotherapy in patients with advanced laryngeal, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal carcinomas. design: randomized, controlled, clinical trial, with a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years. setting: the princess margaret hospital, toronto, ontario. patients: patients with advanced laryngopharyngeal carcinoma (t3 or t4 or n+). intervention: three hundred thirty-six patients who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, clinical trial and treated with primary radiotherapy using either the standard fractionation regimen or the hyperfractionation regimen. one hundred eight patients with recurrent disease underwent salvage surgery and were observed prospectively, with careful documentation of surgical and tumor data, complications, recurrences, and survival. main outcome measures: surgical complication rate and survival. results: of the 108 patients who underwent surgery, 29 (27%) had complications. one third of these had multiple complications. there was no statistical difference between the surgical complication rates of the 2 radiotherapy groups (16 patients [28%] in the standard fractionation radiotherapy group and 13 [25%] in the hyperfractionation radiotherapy group). survival after surgery was statistically correlated with the tnm system for the stage of the recurrent tumor, the pathologic nodal status, and the surgical margin status. the overall 3-year survival rate, which was calculated from the date of surgery, for the group of patients who underwent surgery was 22%. conclusions: in this patient population, the hyperfractionation regimen was not associated with a higher surgical complication rate. using the policy of primary radiotherapy and reserving surgery for the management of failures of radiotherapy, 140 patients (71%) at highest risk (laryngeal and hypopharyngeal primary tumor sites) retained an intact larynx until the end of the study or death. since it is the stage of the recurrent tumor that correlates with survival rather than the stage of

"communication after laryngectomy: an assessment of patient satisfaction. objectives: to determine the satisfaction of patients with their current method of alaryngeal communication. to focus primarily on the patients' perception of their own speech. design: a retrospective review of patients who underwent total laryngectomy for malignancy identified 4 groups of patients. a survey using a mailed questionnaire was used to compare groups. setting: tertiary care university hospital, university of texas medical branch at galveston. patients: forty-seven patients underwent total laryngectomy for cancer and survived. thirty-one of the 47 patients responded to the survey. patients were divided into 4 groups by their current method of communication: (1) tablet writers; (2) esophageal speech; (3) electrolarynx; and (4) tracheoesophageal speech. main outcome measures: satisfaction with communication, satisfaction with speech quality, ability to communicate over telephone, limitation of interaction with others, and satisfaction with quality of life. results: patients in group 4 were significantly more satisfied with their speech (p<.001), perceived their speech to be of better quality (p<.001), had improved ability to communicate over the telephone (p<.001), and had less limitation of their interactions with others (p<.004). patients in group 4 also rated their overall quality of life higher (p=.23). conclusion: although many studies in the past have demonstrated the objective superiority of tracheoesophageal speech compared with other methods of alaryngeal communication, most studies have focused on the intelligibility of speech judged by listeners. this study demonstrates that patients who use tracheoesophageal speech rate their own speech significantly higher than patients who use other methods and most likely have an overall superior quality of life.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:493-496",esophageal speech;;tracheoesophageal speech;;alaryngeal communication;;current method;;total laryngectomy;;tertiary care university hospital;;texas medical branch;;tracheoesophageal speech rate;;main outcome measures;;overall superior quality;;laryngectomy;;patient satisfaction,"communication after laryngectomy: an assessment of patient satisfaction.;;objectives: to determine the satisfaction of patients with their current method of alaryngeal communication.;;to focus primarily on the patients' perception of their own speech.;;design: a retrospective review of patients who underwent total laryngectomy for malignancy identified 4 groups of patients.;;a survey using a mailed questionnaire was used to compare groups.;;setting: tertiary care university hospital, university of texas medical branch at galveston.;;patients: forty-seven patients underwent total laryngectomy for cancer and survived.;;thirty-one of the 47 patients responded to the survey.;;patients were divided into 4 groups by their current method of communication: (1) tablet writers;

"overexpression of cyclin d1 indicates a poor prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. objectives: to evaluate the overexpression of cyclin d1 and p53 as a prognostic marker of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and to investigate whether deregulation of these genes is associated with an unfavorable course of disease. design: retrospective study. materials and methods: formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor materials that were obtained from a well-characterized series of 115 patients with resectable head and neck cancer at the netherlands cancer institute, amsterdam, were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods using antiserum samples that were directed against 2 proteins (ie, cyclin d1 and p53), which are crucial in the regulation of the g1 phase of the cell cycle. results: overexpression of cyclin d1 protein was found in 49% of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. this overexpression was not associated with known prognostic factors (eg, the t and n stages). tumors recurred more frequently and in a shorter period in patients whose primary tumors showed an overexpression of cyclin d1 protein. this difference (p=.05) was statistically significant in a stepwise proportional hazard regression analysis. however, since a discrepancy in staining results was observed between the biopsy and resection materials that were taken from the same patient, this result may not have been applicable in the evaluation of biopsy specimens only. this discrepancy is most likely owing to tissue heterogeneity. the overexpression of p53 that was found in 42% of the patients was of no prognostic significance. conclusions: these data provide evidence that overrexpression of cyclin d1 protein in resection material of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck is indicative of a poor prognosis, independently of other known prognostic factors. whether overexpression of cyclin d1 may therefore be used to select

"absence of p53 mutations in squamous carcinomas of the tongue in nonsmoking and nondrinking patients younger than 40 years. background: although carcinoma of the tongue usually occurs in patients older than 60 years, up to 4% of these tumors may occur in patients younger than 40 years. many of the younger patients with this tumor have had no exposure or brief exposure to tobacco smoke or alcohol consumption, to which oral carcinoma is usually attributed. the molecular mechanism responsible for carcinogenesis in this group of patients is not known. objective: to assess the role of p53 gene mutation in oral carcinogenesis in a group of patients younger than 40 years with squamous carcinoma of the tongue. design: squamous carcinoma cells were isolated from paraffin blocks by microdissection. dna extracted from these cells was tested for the presence of p53 mutations by polymerase chain reaction and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis. mutations identified by this procedure were directly sequenced. sections of the tumors were also stained using an immunoperoxidase immunohistochemical technique for expression of p53 protein. subjects: eleven patients were selected on the basis of 2 criteria: presence of squamous cell carcinoma and age younger than 40 years. six of the 11 patients had no history of measurable tobacco or alcohol exposure. results: two mutations were detected among 11 tumors by single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis, one in exon 4 and a second in exon 7. the former mutation consisted of g:c to c:g (guanine:cytosine to cytosine:guanine) transition in codon 72 (cgc to ccc), which would have resulted in the substitution of a proline residue for arginine. with the immunoperoxidase immunohistochemical technique for p53 protein, strong, diffuse nuclear staining was observed only in this tumor. the second mutation was a g:c to a:t (guanine:cytosine to adenine:thymine) transition in codon 248 (cgg to cga), which would have resulted in no amino acid change since both mutant and wildtype codon sequences encode arginine. weaker and more variable anti-p53 immunostaining was noted in this and 4 other tumors. five tumors were negative for p53 protein by the immunoperoxidase immunohistochemical technique. conclusions: our results suggest that p53 gene mutations are less frequent in squamous carcinomas occurring in nonsmoking young patients who do not drink alcohol than in young smokers or in the general population. paucity of p53 mutations may be explained by the absence of exposure to tobacco smoke or alcohol. these data leave unanswered the question of the molecular mechanism responsible for oral carcinogenesis in this group of patients and suggest that this group may be a suitable population in which to study genetic susceptibility to aerodigestive carcinoma isolated from the confounding factors of tobacco and alcohol exposure.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:503-506",squamous

"experimental trial of balloon-expandable, metallic palmaz stent in the trachea. objective: to determine the effect of the palmaz stent, which has been successfully used to relieve airway obstruction in a small group of children, on the normal and operated on animal trachea. design: in this experimental trial, stents were placed bronchoscopically in the thoracic tracheae of 4 groups of 50 anesthetized cats. the cats in group 1 (adults, n=10) and group 2 (kittens, n=10) had normal tracheae; the cats in group 3 (adults, n=15) underwent horizontal tracheal incision and closure; and the cats in group 4 (adults, n=15) underwent pericardial patch tracheoplasty. in groups 3 and 4, the stents were inserted in 10 cats and 5 cats served as controls. stents were inflated to a 15-mm diameter in group 1 and an 8-mm diameter in the other groups. half of the animals with stents were killed 5 weeks after the procedure, and the others, 10 weeks after the procedure. setting: the hospital for sick children, toronto, ontario. results: in group 1, 1 animal died of tracheal perforation. a mild cough was noted in 15 of the 39 cats with stents. in group 4, 3 cats had difficulty eating and lost weight. the results of esophagoscopy excluded esophageal inflammation or obstruction in these 3 animals. the results of bronchoscopy indicated a nonobstructing rim of granulation tissue at the end of the stent in 15 of 20 cats in groups 1 and 2 and 17 of 20 cats in groups 3 and 4 and at the repair site in all animals with stents from groups 3 and 4. the results of autopsy indicated the cross-sectional area at the site of the stent was greater than normal in group 1 (p<.003) and smaller than the normal trachea at the site of the tracheoplasty in group 4 controls without stents (p<.02); however, the cross-sectional area at the tracheoplasty site with the stent was not smaller (p<.13). the results of histologic examination indicated a mild inflammatory reaction, with granulation tissue in all animals with stents, but in group 1, with overexpanded stents, the reaction was more severe, with epithelial ulceration, fibrosis, and sealed-off perforations in most animals. in group 3, the tracheae with stents had significantly more inflammatory reaction, granulation tissue, and epithelial damage than the controls without stents. conclusions: the palmaz stent provokes an inflammatory reaction in the normal trachea and the trachea recently operated on. with the exception of the group 1 animals with overexpanded stents, this reaction is clinically insignificant. the palmaz stent is able to maintain a normal lumen size after pericardial tracheoplasty in cats.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1993;119:522-528",stents;;palmaz stent;;granulation tissue;;normal trachea;;inflammatory reaction;;tracheoplasty;;experimental trial;;overexpanded stents;;trachea;;tracheae;;significantly more inflammatory reaction;;metallic palmaz stent,"experimental trial of balloon-expandable, metallic palmaz stent in the trachea.;;objective: to determine the effect of the palmaz stent, which has been successfully used to relieve airway obstruction in a small group of children, on the normal and operated on animal trachea.;;design: in this experimental trial, stents were placed bronchoscopically in the thoracic tracheae of 4 groups of 50 anesthetized cats.;;the cats in group 1 (adults, n=10) and group 2 (kittens, n=10) had normal tracheae;

pigmented villonodular synovitis of the temporomandibular joint. pigmented villonodular synovitis is a proliferative disorder affecting the synovium and may be an aggressive local process with bone destruction and invasion of contiguous structures. involvement of the temporomandibular joint is very rare. we report a rare case of pigmented villonodular synovitis of the temporomandibular joint that invaded the infratemporal fossa with bone destruction of the mandibular condyle. magnetic resonance imaging was effective in delineating the extent of the lesion in the infratemporal fossa. fine-needle aspiration cytology showed multinucleated giant cells and round or spindle-shaped cells with hemosiderin deposits. the tumor was resected en bloc through a combined temporocervical and infratemporal fossa approach. the postoperative histological diagnosis was a variant of pigmented villonodular synovitis. fine-needle aspiration cytology and magnetic resonance imaging proved to be useful in the preoperative diagnosis of pigmented villonodular synovitis of the temporomandibular joint and in the preoperative planning that is required to obtain adequate surgical margins.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:536-539,pigmented villonodular synovitis;;villonodular synovitis;;temporomandibular joint;;infratemporal fossa;;fine-needle aspiration cytology;;magnetic resonance imaging;;bone destruction;;round or spindle-shaped cells;;aggressive local process;;infratemporal fossa approach;;multinucleated giant cells;;adequate surgical margins;;postoperative histological diagnosis;;proliferative disorder;;contiguous structures;;spindle-shaped cells;;hemosiderin deposits;;rare case;;preoperative planning,pigmented villonodular synovitis of the temporomandibular joint.;;pigmented villonodular synovitis is a proliferative disorder affecting the synovium and may be an aggressive local process with bone destruction and invasion of contiguous structures.;;involvement of the temporomandibular joint is very rare.;;we report a rare case of pigmented villonodular synovitis of the temporomandibular joint that invaded the infratemporal fossa with bone destruction of the mandibular condyle.;;magnetic resonance imaging was effective in delineating the extent of the lesion in the infratemporal fossa.;;fine-needle aspiration cytology showed multinucleated giant cells and round or spindle-shaped cells with hemosiderin deposits.;;the tumor was resected en bloc through a combined temporocervical and infratemporal fossa approach.;;the postoperative histological diagnosis was a variant of pigmented villonodular synovitis.;;fine-needle aspiration cytology and magnetic resonance imaging proved to be useful in the preoperative diagnosis of pigmented villonodular synovitis of the temporomandibular joint and in the preoperative planning that is required to obtain adequate surgical margins.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:536-539,giant cells;;infratemporal fossa approach;;contiguous structures;;involvement;;fine-needle aspiration cytology;;preoperative planning;;proliferative disorder;;delineating;;magnetic resonance;;aggressive local process;;bloc;;villonodular synovitis;;lesion;;temporomandibular joint;;spindle-shaped cells;;extent;;invasion;;hemosiderin deposits;;bone destruction;;pigmented villonodular synovitis;;rare case;;tumor;;mandibular condyle;;preoperative diagnosis;;postoperative histological diagnosis;;infratemporal fossa;;synovium;;round

"porous high-density polyethylene implants in auricular reconstruction. objective: to evaluate the ability of porous high-density polyethylene (medpor) implants to tolerate exposure and support skin grafts when used to reconstruct defects in auricular cartilage in an animal model. design: polyethylene implants placed in surgically created defects in auricular cartilage and covered with a skin flap were then exposed at either 4, 7, or 21 days after implantation. the exposed implants were then allowed to heal secondarily or received a skin graft 1 week later. the ability of polyethylene implants to tolerate exposure and support skin grafts was observed clinically and via histological study of the implantation sites. subjects: nine adult new zealand rabbits. results: polyethylene implants demonstrated excellent ability to tolerate wound exposure as early as 4 days after implantation, with extrusion of 1 of the 36 implants placed. the degree of secondary wound healing increased as the interval from implantation to exposure increased from 4 to 21 days. exposed polyethylene implants in all groups also supported all 18 skin grafts placed 1 week after exposure of the implant surface. conclusions: polyethylene implants are well tolerated as replacements for native cartilage in auricular reconstruction. polyethylene implants tolerated wound exposure as early as 4 days after implantation and demonstrated the ability to heal by secondary intention and support skin grafts. this is likely because of the extent of fibrovascular ingrowth from surrounding tissue, which allows the material to behave more like native tissue and less like a foreign body in this setting.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:578-583",polyethylene implants;;skin graft;;skin grafts;;support skin grafts;;porous high-density polyethylene;;auricular cartilage;;auricular reconstruction;;wound exposure;;nine adult new zealand rabbits;;porous high-density polyethylene implants;;adult new zealand rabbits;;secondary wound healing;;exposed polyethylene implants;;animal model,"porous high-density polyethylene implants in auricular reconstruction.;;objective: to evaluate the ability of porous high-density polyethylene (medpor) implants to tolerate exposure and support skin grafts when used to reconstruct defects in auricular cartilage in an animal model.;;design: polyethylene implants placed in surgically created defects in auricular cartilage and covered with a skin flap were then exposed at either 4, 7, or 21 days after implantation.;;the exposed implants were then allowed to heal secondarily or received a skin graft 1 week later.;;the ability of polyethylene implants to tolerate exposure and support skin grafts was observed clinically and via histological study of the implantation sites.;;subjects: nine adult new zealand rabbits.;;results: polyethylene implants demonstrated excellent ability to tolerate wound exposure as early as 4 days after implantation, with extrusion of 1 of the 36 implants placed.;;the degree of secondary wound healing increased as the interval from implantation to exposure increased from 4 to 21 days.;;exposed polyethylene implants in all groups also supported all 18 skin grafts placed 1 week after exposure of the implant surface.;;conclusions: polyethylene implants are well tolerated as replacements for native cartilage in auricular reconstruction.;;polyethylene implants tolerated wound exposure as early as 4 days after implantation and demonstrated the ability to heal by secondary intention and support skin grafts.;;this is likely because of the extent of fibrovascular ingrowth from surrounding tissue, which allows the material to behave more like native tissue and less like a foreign body in this setting.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:578-583",interval;;extent;;support skin grafts;;implantation;;implants;;results;;porous high-density polyethylene;;skin grafts;;design;;defects;;skin flap;;subjects;;replacements;;excellent ability;;conclusions;;histological study;;skin graft;;porous high-density polyethylene implants;;native tissue;;objective;;week;;animal model;;ability;;degree;;secondary wound healing;;material;;auricular cartilage;;medpor;;groups;;polyethylene implants;;exposure;;extrusion;;setting.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;wound exposure;;adult new zealand rabbits;;tissue;;days;;foreign body;;fibrovascular ingrowth;;auricular reconstruction;;native cartilage;;implant surface;;secondary intention
"shrapnell membrane and mastoid pneumatization. objective: to assess whether a correlation exists between the degree of pars flaccida (pf) retraction and the degree of mastoid pneumatization. design: the degree of pf retraction was defined by means of an operating microscope and a pneumatic otoscope. degree of mastoid pneumatization was assessed planimetrically, using mastoid x-rays. setting: private otologic clinic. participants: a total of 595 ears, with intact pars tensa, of 332 adult patients. results: the degree of pf retraction was found to be inversely correlated to the level of mastoid pneumatization. poorly pneumatized mastoids were associated with pf retractions. the poorer the pneumatization, the deeper the retraction. well-pneumatized mastoids were associated with normal position of the pf. conclusions: this study lends further support to the possibility that the mastoid pneumatic system functions as a middle ear pressure buffer. this possibility gives further explanation as to why ears with poorly pneumatized mastoids tend to develop tympanic membrane retractions and perforations, incus necrosis, or retraction pocket cholesteatoma, while ears with a large pneumatic system are rarely at such risk.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:584-588",mastoid pneumatization;;pneumatized mastoids;;pars flaccida retraction;;pneumatization;;poorly pneumatized mastoids;;retraction;;mastoid pneumatic system functions;;middle ear pressure buffer;;deeper the retraction;;tympanic membrane retractions;;private otologic clinic;;retractions and perforations;;retraction pocket cholesteatoma;;adult patients;;poorer the pneumatization;;large pneumatic system;;shrapnell membrane,"shrapnell membrane and mastoid pneumatization.;;objective: to assess whether a correlation exists between the degree of pars flaccida (pf) retraction and the degree of mastoid pneumatization.;;design: the degree of pf retraction was defined by means of an operating microscope and a pneumatic otoscope.;;degree of mastoid pneumatization was assessed planimetrically, using mastoid x-rays.;;setting: private otologic clinic.;;participants: a total of 595 ears, with intact pars tensa, of 332 adult patients.;;results: the degree of pf retraction was found to be inversely correlated to the level of mastoid pneumatization.;;poorly pneumatized mastoids were associated with pf retractions.;;the poorer the pneumatization, the deeper the retraction.;;well-pneumatized mastoids were associated with normal position of the pf.;;conclusions: this study lends further support to the possibility that the mastoid pneumatic system functions as a middle ear pressure buffer.;;this possibility gives further explanation as to why ears with poorly pneumatized mastoids tend to develop tympanic membrane retractions and perforations, incus necrosis, or retraction pocket cholesteatoma, while ears with a large pneumatic system are rarely at such risk.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:584-588",intact pars;;results;;assess;;mastoid pneumatic system functions;;design;;shrapnell membrane;;total;;tympanic membrane retractions;;conclusions;;pneumatic otoscope;;pf retractions;;operating microscope;;further explanation;;participants;;pf;;normal position;;objective;;mastoid pneumatization;;adult patients;;deeper;;degree;;means;;pneumatization;;perforations;;possibility;;poorer;;pf retraction;;mastoids;;pars;;retraction;;retraction pocket cholesteatoma;;level;;study;;mastoid x-rays;;further support;;private otologic;;well-pneumatized mastoids;;correlation;;middle ear pressure buffer;;such risk.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;large pneumatic system;;necrosis;;ears

"airway management of neonates with antenatally detected head and neck anomalies. five cases of prenatally detected neck masses that had a potential for airway obstruction at birth are described. the various options for management of the airway are discussed, including using maternal-fetal circulation until intubation, rigid bronchoscopy, tracheotomy, cyst aspiration, or extracorporeal membrane oxygen support. congenital abnormalities involving the fetal face or neck are extremely rare. with technical advances in ultrasonography, these masses were first noted on prenatal ultrasound in the late 1970s. before that period, they were detected at delivery. these masses are solid or cystic and may cause asphyxia because of airway obstruction at the time of delivery. the survivability of these neonates without immediate intervention at birth is 0% to 20%. if a neck mass is detected in the fetus by prenatal ultrasonography, then a strategic plan for these types of cases should be developed early in the prenatal period. the airway management plan should be tailored for each individual case. coordination and the expertise of an obstetrician, neonatologist, anesthesiologist, and pediatric otolaryngologist are needed to manage these complex situations.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:641-645",neck mass;;airway management;;airway obstruction;;prenatally detected neck masses;;fetal face or neck;;extracorporeal membrane oxygen support;;airway management plan;;five cases;;neck anomalies;;neck masses;;congenital abnormalities;;individual case;;late 1970s;;technical advances;;prenatal ultrasound;;cyst aspiration;;fetal face,"airway management of neonates with antenatally detected head and neck anomalies.;;five cases of prenatally detected neck masses that had a potential for airway obstruction at birth are described.;;the various options for management of the airway are discussed, including using maternal-fetal circulation until intubation, rigid bronchoscopy, tracheotomy, cyst aspiration, or extracorporeal membrane oxygen support.;;congenital abnormalities involving the fetal face or neck are extremely rare.;;with technical advances in ultrasonography, these masses were first noted on prenatal ultrasound in the late 1970s.;;before that period, they were detected at delivery.;;these masses are solid or cystic and may cause asphyxia because of airway obstruction at the time of delivery.;;the survivability of these neonates without immediate intervention at birth is 0% to 20%.;;if a neck mass is detected in the fetus by prenatal ultrasonography, then a strategic plan for these types of cases should be developed early in the prenatal period.;;the airway management plan should be tailored for each individual case.;;coordination and the expertise of an obstetrician, neonatologist, anesthesiologist, and pediatric otolaryngologist are needed to manage these complex situations.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:641-645",airway management plan;;congenital abnormalities;;anesthesiologist;;fetus;;neck mass;;prenatal ultrasonography;;period;;bronchoscopy;;expertise;;technical advances;;prenatal ultrasound;;individual case;;coordination;;ultrasonography;;asphyxia;;management;;cyst aspiration;;masses;;fetal face;;survivability;;intubation;;immediate intervention;;prenatal period;;airway management;;tracheotomy;;head;;manage;;using maternal-fetal circulation;;extracorporeal membrane oxygen support;;various options;;neonatologist;;pediatric otolaryngologist;;delivery;;airway obstruction;;neonates;;airway;;cases;;neck anomalies;;types;;neck masses;;neck;;strategic plan;;complex situations.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;time

"computer-assisted resection of benign sinonasal tumors with skull base and orbital extension. objective: to use freehand, real-time, intraoperative, 3-dimensional computed tomography (3-d ct) localization to assist with resection of sinonasal lesions with skull-base and/or orbital extension. design: the 3-d ct is computer-assisted technology using the preoperative ct scan as a road map for resection of lesions. previous technology, while resulting in little intraoperative error, required use of a somewhat cumbersome rigid articulated arm and attached probe, limiting mobility and requiring rigid fixation of the head to maintain system reference. a new freehand version of this technology, eliminating these limitations, has been used for resection of benign sinonasal lesions with skull-base and/or orbital extension. setting: tertiary care, university-based practice. patients: seven patients prospectively selected with benign lesions involving the sinonasal cavity and orbit and/or skull base. intervention: all patients underwent surgical resection of their tumors using endoscopic, open, or combined procedures with the assistance of freehand 3-d ct localization. main outcome assessment: surgeon assessment of usefulness. results: in several cases, the device assisted the operator in determining the exact location of a displaced optic nerve, ensuring vision preservation, while in other cases, the location and depth of skull-base penetration was clearly determined, allowing resection via a transnasal endoscopic approach. in addition, the device was useful for determining the depth of necessary resection for optimal cosmetic result. in all cases, system accuracy was within less than 2 mm at the operative site. system limitations included need for an additional preoperative ct and time required at the beginning of the case for system setup and registration. conclusions: freehand 3-d ct, while still with limitations, offers the advantage of

"deficiency of naive t cells in patients with sudden deafness. background: although there are a number of reports concerned with the role of immunity in the sudden onset of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, there are few references dealing with the involvement of immunemediated mechanisms in sudden deafness. objective: to study the phenotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes in a group of patients with sudden deafness by use of 3-color flow cytometry. design: the study was carried out prior to the start of steroid therapy. fourteen patients underwent a follow-up study once steroid therapy had been completed. prospective analysis, case-control. setting: tertiary case referral center, ambulatory and hospitalized care. patients: twenty-two patients (13 men and 9 women; mean age, 45.3 years) were compared with 14 healthy control subjects (9 men and 5 women; mean age, 36 years). patients were divided in 2 groups according to their response to steroid therapy. results: decreased numbers of both cd4+ helper cells (38.4% vs 45.5%;

"comparison of cost and function in reconstruction of the posterior oral cavity and oropharynx: free vs pedicled soft tissue transfer. objective: to compare the cost and functional results of free and pedicled soft tissue reconstruction after posterior oral cavity and oropharyngeal extirpation. design: retrospective study of 53 consecutive patients undergoing extirpation with primary soft tissue reconstruction from january 1, 1991, to december 31, 1995. median follow-up was 298 days. setting: academic tertiary care medical center. intervention: twenty-four patients underwent reconstruction with a pedicled pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (pmmf); 29 patients, with a fasciocutaneous free flap (ff) (27 radial forearm, 1 lateral arm, and 1 scapular). main outcome measures: direct (inpatient hospital resources used and monetary costs) and intangible (postoperative complications and function) costs. results: operative time was longer for ff reconstructions (p=.003), but both patient groups had similar intensive care unit and hospital stays. treatment cost for ff reconstructions was $41 122, compared with $37 160 for pmmf reconstructions (p=.003). this difference was due to increased professional fees for ff reconstruction (p<.001), which was offset by intangible cost differences. the pmmf group tended toward an increased rate of flap-related complications, compared with the ff group. at last follow-up, 4 patients in the ff group (15%) and 3 in the pmmf group (15%) had their tracheotomy. in contrast, 17 (85%) patients in the pmmf group and 11 (39%) patients in the ff group required enteral tube feedings (p=.002). also, 18 (64%) patients in the ff group were eating at least a soft diet compared with 6 (30%) patients in the pmmf group (p=.02). conclusions: comparison of direct costs reveals only a modest difference in reconstruction costs that is outweighed by the intangible costs of pmmf reconstruction. the functional benefits of ff reconstruction appear to justify its slight increased expense and its use rather than pmmf reconstruction after extirpation in the posterior oral cavity and oropharynx.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:731-737",pectoralis major myocutaneous flap;;free flap group;;pectoralis major myocutaneous flap group;;free flap reconstruction;;posterior oral cavity;;pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction;;posterior oral cavity and oropharynx;;cost and function;;free flap reconstructions;;pedicled pectoralis major myocutaneous flap;;pedicled soft tissue transfer;;pedicled soft tissue reconstruction;;cost and functional results,"comparison of cost and function in reconstruction of the posterior oral cavity and oropharynx: free vs pedicled soft tissue transfer.;;objective: to compare the cost and functional results of free and pedicled soft tissue reconstruction after posterior oral cavity and oropharyngeal extirpation.;;design: retrospective study of 53 consecutive patients undergoing extirpation with primary soft tissue reconstruction from january 1, 1991, to december 31, 1995. median follow-up was 298 days.;;setting: academic tertiary care medical center.;;intervention: twenty-four patients underwent reconstruction with a pedicled pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (pmmf);

"use of alar batten grafts for correction of nasal valve collapse. objective: to determine the efficacy of alar batten grafts for the correction of internal and external nasal valve collapse. design: in this retrospective study, a questionnaire was used to ask patients to rate their nasal breathing before and after application of alar batten grafts. setting: private practice and academic tertiary referral medical center. patients: the questionnaire was given to 63 patients who underwent application of alar batten grafts between 1980 and 1995. forty-six patients (73%) responded and were included in the study. intervention: alar batten grafts were applied into a precise pocket via a limited endonasal incision or via the external rhinoplasty approach. the grafts consisted of curved septal cartilage or auricular cartilage and were applied to the site of maximal lateral nasal wall collapse. the convex surface of the cartilage was oriented laterally to allow maximal lateralization of the collapsed portion of the lateral nasal wall. in most cases, alar batten grafts were applied caudal to the existing lateral crura and extended from the lateral one third of the lateral crura to the piriform aperture. outcome measures: the degree of nasal airway obstruction was determined by subjective scoring on a scale from 1 (no obstruction) to 5 (complete obstruction) before and after surgery. the patency of the internal airway was also assessed on physical examination. results: the results of the study revealed that all but 1 of the 46 patients experienced an improvement in their nasal airway obstruction. the mean improvement in nasal airway obstruction was 2.5 on a scale of 5. patients that had the least improvement had intranasal scarring in the region of the internal nasal valve, loss of vestibular skin, or excessive narrowing at the piriform aperture. physical examination revealed a significant increase in the size of the aperture at the internal or external nasal valve after the application of the alar batten grafts. there was minimal postoperative fullness in the supraalar region, where the alar batten grafts were applied. with time, this fullness decreased, leaving little evidence of the graft and an overall improvement in the aesthetic result. conclusions: alar batten grafts are effective for longterm correction of internal and external nasal valve collapse that is not complicated by intranasal scarring in the region of the nasal valve, loss of vestibular skin, or excessive narrowing at the piriform aperture.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.

portion of the lateral nasal wall.;;in most cases, alar batten grafts were applied caudal to the existing lateral crura and extended from the lateral one third of the lateral crura to the piriform aperture.;;outcome measures: the degree of nasal airway obstruction was determined by subjective scoring on a scale from 1 (no obstruction) to 5 (complete obstruction) before and after surgery.;;the patency of the internal airway was also assessed on physical examination.;;results: the results of the study revealed that all but 1 of the 46 patients experienced an improvement in their nasal airway obstruction.;;the mean improvement in nasal airway obstruction was 2.5 on a scale of 5. patients that had the least improvement had intranasal scarring in the region of the internal nasal valve, loss of vestibular skin, or excessive narrowing at the piriform aperture.;;physical examination revealed a significant increase in the size of the aperture at the internal or external nasal valve after the application of the alar batten grafts.;;there was minimal postoperative fullness in the supraalar region, where the alar batten grafts were applied.;;with time, this fullness decreased, leaving little evidence of the graft and an overall improvement in the aesthetic result.;;conclusions: alar batten grafts are effective for longterm correction of internal and external nasal valve collapse that is not complicated by intranasal scarring in the region of the nasal valve, loss of vestibular skin, or excessive narrowing at the piriform aperture.arch otolaryngol head neck

"lipogranulomas as complications of septorhinoplasty. background: nasal tumors caused by lipogranulomas are a rare complication of a rhinoplasty; only 1 report of this occurrence was found in the literature. objective: to present a series of 4 patients with subcutaneous nasal tumors after each had undergone a rhinoplasty, together with a review of the literature and the clinical consequences. design: case series. setting: hospitalized care at a university ear, nose, and throat department. patients: four patients were referred within 6 months from a single department for consultation because of broad nasal pyramids after each patient had undergone a rhinoplasty. the origin of the deformities was not known. interventions: ear, nose, and throat and ultrasound examinations and computed tomography (ie, bone and soft tissue examinations). two patients had undergone revision surgery and histological examinations of subcutaneous fibrous tissue. main outcome measure: search for the origin of the nasal deformity. results: all 4 patients had wide nasal pyramids. one of the 4 patients also had subcutaneous tumors of the nasal dorsum, glabella, and medial canthus area; this patient had subcutaneous cystic lesions on computed tomography and ultrasound examination and a foreign body reaction around ""empty spaces"" on histological examination. the tumorlike lesions were the result of displaced ointment from the endonasal packings. two of the 4 patients with minor deformities did not undergo any surgical revision, and they still had some moderate reduction of the cystic lesions within 1 year after the rhinoplasty. conclusions: lipogranulomas caused by ointments that are used together with nasal packings are most often reported in the orbit after endonasal sinus surgery. the incidence should be more frequent in patients who undergo a rhinoplasty because connections between the endonasal cavity and the extranasal subcutaneous layer are created routinely by osteotomies or removal of a hump. thus, postoperative deformities (eg, inadequate narrowing of the bony pyramid or supratip thickening [permanent swelling of the nasal tip]) should be examined by use of computed tomography, if lipid ointments were used endonasally. for prevention, no lipid substances should be applied together with pressure from packings. in the case of a lipogranuloma, surgical removal via an open approach is the treatment of choice.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:809-814",computed tomography;;nasal tumors;;histological examination;;cystic lesions;;nasal packings;;ultrasound examination;;lipogranulomas;;packings;;rhinoplasty;;revision surgery and histological examinations;;wide nasal pyramids;;subcutaneous cystic lesions;;endonasal sinus surgery;;subcutaneous nasal tumors;;extranasal subcutaneous layer,"lipogranulomas as complications of septorhinoplasty.;;background: nasal tumors caused by lipogranulomas are a rare complication of a rhinoplasty;

endoscopic excision of a forehead mass. endoscopic applications in facial plastic surgery have recently increased with the advent of new instrumentation and as surgeons have become more accustomed to their use. we report the first case (to our knowledge) of an endoscopic removal of a forehead soft tissue mass. the endoscopic approach allows the surgeon access to the forehead area with placement of a skin incision in the hair-bearing scalp. this type of approach is especially of value in patients with a predisposition to unusual scar formation or in those with smooth skin in which a direct incision would yield a noticeable scar.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:815-817,forehead soft tissue mass;;facial plastic surgery;;unusual scar formation;;forehead mass;;endoscopic applications;;endoscopic excision;;new instrumentation;;hair-bearing scalp;;endoscopic removal;;surgeon access;;direct incision;;smooth skin;;first case;;skin incision;;endoscopic approach;;noticeable scar,endoscopic excision of a forehead mass.;;endoscopic applications in facial plastic surgery have recently increased with the advent of new instrumentation and as surgeons have become more accustomed to their use.;;we report the first case (to our knowledge) of an endoscopic removal of a forehead soft tissue mass.;;the endoscopic approach allows the surgeon access to the forehead area with placement of a skin incision in the hair-bearing scalp.;;this type of approach is especially of value in patients with a predisposition to unusual scar formation or in those with smooth skin in which a direct incision would yield a noticeable scar.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:815-817,endoscopic removal;;noticeable scar.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;endoscopic applications;;skin incision;;skin;;use;;hair-bearing scalp;;forehead mass;;surgeon access;;surgeons;;endoscopic excision;;endoscopic approach;;approach;;unusual scar formation;;direct incision;;first case;;facial plastic surgery;;new instrumentation;;knowledge;;placement;;predisposition;;forehead area;;type;;advent;;value;;patients;;forehead soft tissue mass
"intraoperative mapping of sensate flaps: electrophysiologic techniques and neurosomal boundaries. background: the desirability of restoring sensation to the upper aerodigestive tract has led to an expanded use of sensate flaps for reconstruction of mucosal defects. sensation can be restored via preformed neural pathways through the anastomosis of recipient and donor nerves, provided that the sensate flap falls within the boundaries of the neurosome for the identified sensory nerve. objectives: to perform detailed electrophysiologic mappings of neurosomes of potential sensate flap donor sites, to describe their variability, and to investigate the usefulness of intraoperative mapping in terms of flap design and harvesting. design: a case series of 27 patients who were undergoing free flap reconstruction of various postablative head and neck defects were examined. two silver〞silver chloride recording electrodes were placed in direct contact with the dissected sensory nerve, and the overlying skin was either mechanically or electrically stimulated. auditory feedback, as well as visualization of the responses on an oscilloscope, determined whether the stimulated area fell within the neurosome. this technique was applied to the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve of the radial forearm flap (n=15), the lateral sural cutaneous nerve of the fibula flap (n=5), the subcostal nerve of the iliac crest flap (n=6), and the dorsal cutaneous rami of spinal nerve t-1 or t-2 of the scapula flap (n=1). results: the neurosome of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve was relatively consistent with the variability only at the distal boundary (ie, the dorsum of the hand). the neurosome of the lateral sural cutaneous nerve was more variable, falling into 2 distinct innervation patterns: one showing innervation that was limited to the upper lateral and posterior portions of the calf and the other demonstrating significant extension into the lower half of the calf. the neurosome of the subcostal nerve showed little variability and consistently overlapped the proposed skin paddle. the neurosome of the t-1 or t-2 spinal nerve was mapped in 1 patient and is described. conclusions: the consistency of neurosomal boundaries is dependent on the donor site. intraoperative mapping of flap donor sites may not only assure the harvesting of a true sensate flap, but may also allow for intraoperative decision making with regard to possible modifications of flap design and harvesting techniques. two new sensate flaps from the iliac crest and scapula are accurately

"lateral arm microvascular flap in head and neck reconstruction. objectives: to report our results of a study of 28 patients who underwent sequential reconstructions of the head and neck using the lateral arm flap. to discuss the situations where we have found the procedure useful, report the complication rates, and delineate the advantages and disadvantages of using this flap. design: a clinical series of patients was followed up prospectively. the swallowing function of a subgroup that underwent oropharyngeal reconstruction was compared with that of a simultaneous control group that underwent reconstruction with the pectoralis major flap. setting: university medical center. participants: patients with malignant neoplasms of the head and neck who underwent resections and reconstruction with the lateral arm flap. interventions: twenty-eight patients underwent head and neck reconstruction using lateral arm flaps. in 17 patients, the lateral arm flaps were used for pharyngeal and posterior oral cavity defects. thirteen of these patients underwent reinnervation. nine combined palatal and midfacial defects were reconstructed, and 1 lateral facial defect was reconstructed. most cases were advanced malignant neoplasms and represented a selected minority of similar resections performed at our institutions. three maxillary reconstructions were performed secondarily. all other reconstructions were performed at the time of tumor ablation. main outcome measures: data were collected regarding flap survival, return of sensation in flaps, complication rates, and the ability to feed orally. results: all flaps survived in their entirety. of 7,5 tested flaps acquired sensation. of 14 patients with large oropharyngeal defects, 8 resumed early oral feeding and all survivors eventually obtained nutrition orally. the ability to swallow was superior to the results obtained in a retrospective analysis of a group reconstructed using pectoralis major flaps. conclusions: a unique feature of this flap is that it incorporates both thin skin from the proximal forearm and thicker skin from the upper arm. this is ideal for an oropharyngeal defect, where the thin malleable portion can be used in the posterior oral cavity or pharyngeal wall and the thicker portion in the tongue base. either portion can be used alone as well. the availability of intermediate tissue bulk can also be advantageous for midfacial reconstruction. sensation can be reliably reconstituted with this flap. we think that the lateral arm flap is versatile and has

other areas of involvement. design: retrospective analysis of pediatric patients treated medically for proliferative hemangiomas of the parotid region with or without hemangiomas in other regions. indications for treatment included respiratory symptoms relating to hemangiomas of the upper airway, difficulty feeding, rapid rate of growth of the hemangioma, and deformity or obstruction of the ear canal. setting: new york university multidisciplinary vascular anomaly conference, new york, ny, and the pediatric oncology department of ospedale pediatrico bambino gesu, rome, italy. patients: thirteen patients with proliferative hemangiomas in the parotid area were treated medically to inhibit growth and enhance involution of the hemangioma. intervention: six patients were treated with corticosteroids alone (2-4 mg/kg daily). two patients were treated with corticosteroids (2-4 mg/kg daily) followed by interferon alfa-2a (3 million u/m2 daily) because of a failure to respond to corticosteroid therapy. one patient was treated with interferon alfa-2a alone (3 million u/m2 daily). four patients were initially treated with interferon alfa2a, then treated with corticosteroids. one of these patients required intralesional corticosteroid therapy for a massively enlarged lip and is therefore included in this group. the other patient was given oral corticosteroids for unknown reasons at another institution. in the remaining 2 patients, there was no response to the use of interferon alfa-2a. main outcome measures: the size, bulk, and symptoms relating to the hemangiomas of the patients were assessed. results: none of the patients had a significant improvement of the lesions of the parotid hemangiomas. in contrast, for those patients with clinical symptoms due to hemangiomas elsewhere or with cutaneous involvement typical of hemangiomas, the symptoms improved with either of the above therapies, and the cutaneous areas demonstrated signs of involution.

"effects of sinus surgery on speech. objective: to determine the effects of sinus surgery on the production and perception of speech. design: vocal recordings were performed before, 1 week after, and at least 1 month after sinus surgery. acoustic spectra were analyzed for nasal consonants/m/and/n/, nasalized vowels, and nonnasalized vowels. results for nasal consonants were compared with similar recordings obtained from a group of normal subjects with no history of sinus disease. perceptual analysis of nasalized vowels was conducted by trained phoneticians. setting: private practice at an academic medical center. subjects: five patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and 3 normal subjects. main outcome measures: the spectral characteristics and perceptual attributes of nasal sounds. results: significant differences in spectral properties were observed for the consonants and nasalized vowels recorded before and after surgery (p<.001). perceptual experiments for nasalized vowels demonstrated a postoperative decrease in nasality for the high vowel/i/, as in ""beep,"" and an increase in nasality for the non-high vowel/?/, as in ""bad."" these perceived changes correlated well with acoustic measures of nasal peak amplitudes and the lowest resonance peak amplitude of the vocal tract. conclusions: sinus surgery results in measurable effects on the produced acoustic signal and the perceived nasality of a patient's speech. the identified acoustic correlates may be useful for preoperative counseling of patients concerning expected changes in speech quality following surgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:845-852",sinus surgery;;nasalized vowels;;vowels;;high vowel;;normal subjects;;nasal consonants;;nasality;;consonants;;lowest resonance peak amplitude;;production and perception;;endoscopic sinus surgery;;identified acoustic correlates;;sinus surgery results;;produced acoustic signal;;nasal peak amplitudes;;main outcome measures,"effects of sinus surgery on speech.;;objective: to determine the effects of sinus surgery on the production and perception of speech.;;design: vocal recordings were performed before, 1 week after, and at least 1 month after sinus surgery.;;acoustic spectra were analyzed for nasal consonants/m/and/n/, nasalized vowels, and nonnasalized vowels.;;results for nasal consonants were compared with similar recordings obtained from a group of normal subjects with no history of sinus disease.;;perceptual analysis of nasalized vowels was conducted by trained phoneticians.;;setting: private practice at an academic medical center.;;subjects: five patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and 3 normal subjects.;;main outcome measures: the spectral characteristics and perceptual attributes of nasal sounds.;;results: significant differences in spectral properties were observed for the consonants and nasalized vowels recorded before and after surgery (p<.001).;;perceptual experiments for nasalized vowels demonstrated a postoperative decrease in nasality for the high vowel/i/, as in ""beep,"" and an increase in nasality for the non-high vowel/?/, as in ""bad.;;"" these perceived changes correlated well with acoustic measures of nasal peak amplitudes and the lowest resonance peak amplitude of the vocal tract.;;conclusions: sinus surgery results in measurable effects on the produced acoustic signal and the perceived nasality of a patient's speech.;;the identified acoustic correlates may be useful for preoperative counseling of patients concerning expected changes in speech quality following surgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:845-852",consonants;;nasalized vowels;;sinus disease;;nasal sounds;;acoustic spectra;;perceptual attributes;;nasal consonants;;month;;design;;measurable effects;;nasality;;nasal peak;;surgery;;lowest resonance peak amplitude;;subjects;;perceptual analysis;;similar recordings;;increase;;results;;group;;postoperative decrease;;significant differences;;conclusions;;vocal recordings;;phoneticians;;beep;;surgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;production;;speech;;underwent;;objective;;main;;sinus surgery;;week;;perception;;patient;;vowels;;measures;;nasal;;normal subjects;;preoperative counseling;;effects;;sinus surgery results;;spectral properties;;vocal tract;;private practice;;spectral characteristics;;speech quality;;high vowel/i/;;patients;;perceptual experiments;;academic medical center;;non-high vowel/;;acoustic measures;;changes;;acoustic correlates;;history
"inhibition of lymphocyte function by head and neck carcinoma cell line soluble factors. background: immunosuppression in patients with head and neck cancer is well recognized. previous investigations have demonstrated graded immunosuppression that becomes more pronounced as lymphocyte activity is measured closer to the primary neoplasm. in fresh tumors, a soluble factor has been identified that may partly account for the observed graded immunosuppression. objective: to examine the effect of soluble factors produced by head and neck sqamous cell carcinoma cell lines on the generation of lymphokine activated killer cell cytotoxicity and peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation induced by interleukin 2, concanavalin a, and phytohemagglutinin. design: conditioned supernatant fluids were generated in a 4-day incubation period, using 5 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, and were assayed for the ability to inhibit the generation of lymphokine activated killer cell cytotoxicity and naive peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation induced by interleukin 2, concanavalin a, and phytohemagglutinin. results: all conditioned supernatant fluids significantly inhibited the generation of lymphokine activated killer cell cytotoxicity relative to controls, and this inhibition was dose dependent. in contrast, supernatant fluids from a myelogenous leukemic tumor cell line, k562, and an ovarian epithelial cell line, skov-3, failed to inhibit cytotoxicity. supernatant fluids conditioned with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines also profoundly inhibited the naive peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation induced by interleukin 2, concanavalin a, and phytohemagglutinin. conclusions: these studies demonstrate that the cell lines of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma produce soluble factors that inhibit lymphocyte function. furthermore, these experiments suggest that the inhibition previously observed with enzymatically disaggregated fresh tumors is due to factors produced by the tumor cells rather than by other cells within the tumor matrix.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:855-862",soluble factor;;supernatant fluids;;cell

"deletion analysis of the p16/cdkn2 gene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. background: recently, the p16/cdkn2/mts1 gene in the 9p21-22 region has been offered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. we examined the frequency of hemizygous and homozygous deletions of p16/cdkn2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. design: twenty-one hnscc and 12 corresponding normal dna samples were examined for deletion of p16/cdkn2 using pcr amplification and fluorescent quantification of dna. all tumor and normal dna samples were also amplified with fluorescein-labeled primers for a control dna marker on chromosome 8p (d8s265). the ratios of the observed fluorescence of the p16/cdkn2 and 8p pcr products were compared. setting and participants: patients with hnscc scheduled to undergo surgical resection of their tumors were recruited. after the specimen was removed, a portion of the tissue was snap frozen for further dna extraction. results: eight tumors (38%) had p16/cdkn2-d8s265 ratios of greater than 0.75; 8 tumors (38%), from 0.25 to 0.75; and 5 tumors (24%), of less than 0.25, the average ratio in this last group being 0.06. conclusions: these ratios suggest a higher rate of homozygous deletion than previously reported and significant probable hemizygous deletion of the p16/cdkn2 gene in hnscc.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:863-867",p16 cdkn2;;neck squamous cell carcinoma;;quantitative polymerase chain reaction;;p16 cdkn2 gene;;normal dna samples;;homozygous deletion;;head and neck squamous cell carcinoma;;quantitative polymerase chain reaction method;;tumor and normal dna samples;;polymerase chain reaction amplification and fluorescent quantification;;p16 cdkn2 mts1 gene;;candidate tumor suppressor gene;;corresponding normal dna samples;;significant probable hemizygous deletion;;hemizygous and homozygous deletions,"deletion analysis of the p16/cdkn2 gene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.;;background: recently, the p16/cdkn2/mts1 gene in the 9p21-22 region has been offered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene.;;we examined the frequency of hemizygous and homozygous deletions of p16/cdkn2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method.;;design: twenty-one hnscc and 12 corresponding normal dna samples were examined for deletion of p16/cdkn2 using pcr amplification and fluorescent quantification of dna.;;all tumor and normal dna samples were also amplified with fluorescein-labeled primers for a control dna marker on chromosome 8p (d8s265).;;the ratios of the observed fluorescence of the p16/cdkn2 and 8p pcr products were compared.;;setting and participants: patients with hnscc scheduled to undergo surgical resection of their tumors were recruited.;;after the specimen was removed, a portion of the tissue was snap frozen for further dna extraction.;;results: eight tumors (38%) had p16/cdkn2-d8s265 ratios of greater than 0.75; 8 tumors (38%), from 0.25 to 0.75; and 5 tumors (24%), of less than 0.25, the average ratio in this last group being 0.06. conclusions: these ratios suggest a higher rate of homozygous deletion than previously reported and significant probable hemizygous deletion of the p16/cdkn2 gene in hnscc.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1997;123:863-867",pcr amplification;;ratios;;significant probable hemizygous deletion;;homozygous deletion;;results;;hnscc.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;average ratio;;quantitative polymerase chain reaction method;;frequency;;design;;deletion analysis;;higher rate;;chromosome;;normal dna samples;;dna;;twenty-one hnscc;;pcr;;last group;;portion;;homozygous deletions;;participants;;hnscc;;snap;;method;;head;;deletion;;specimen;;neck squamous cell carcinoma;;control dna marker;;fluorescent quantification;;pcr products;;background;;quantitative polymerase chain reaction;;surgical resection;;fluorescence;;region;;conclusions;;fluorescein-labeled primers;;further dna extraction;;p16/cdkn2 gene;;tumor;;patients;;tissue;;p16/cdkn2/mts1 gene;;candidate tumor suppressor gene;;tumors
"neurotropic cutaneous tumors of the head and neck. objective: to determine the outcomes of patients with neurotropic cutaneous tumors of the head and neck. design: a retrospective review was conducted of 7852 charts of patients who underwent micrographically controlled excisions of skin cancers of the head and neck between 1984 and 1995, identifying neurotropic tumors and the outcomes of their treatments. setting: tertiary care center (university hospital). patients: thirty-seven patients with neurotropic tumors were identified (and confirmed by secondary histological review), constituting 0.47% of all patients. the median age at presentation was 68 years and all except an albino were white. nine patients had basal cell carcinomas and 28 had squamous cell carcinomas. twentyfive patients (69%) were referred after at least 1 prior excision was performed a median of 16 months previously. intervention: all patients underwent micrographic mapping and excision of the cutaneous portion of the tumor. as necessitated by tumor spread, additional soft tissue, skull base, and/or intracranial surgery and postoperative irradiation were also conducted. main outcome measures: thirty-four patients (3 patients were unavailable for follow-up) were assessed by physician examination a minimum of 19 months after treatment (median, 33 months). results: of 25 patients with extracranial disease only, 19 had no evidence of disease during follow-up and 1 died of intercurrent disease at 20 months without evidence of tumor persistence. of the 9 patients with intracranial neurotropic tumors at the time of presentation, 1 remained with no evidence of disease, 1 died of intercurrent disease at 21 months without evidence of tumor persistence, and the other 7

"histological and clinical evaluation of facial resurfacing using a carbon dioxide laser with the computer pattern generator. objectives: to delineate the extreme precision and uniformity of tissue ablation with a carbon dioxide laser using the computer pattern generator (cpg) (coherent laser corp, palo alto, calif) and to determine the ideal treatment parameters for uniform tissue ablation with minimal tissue thermal injury. also, to evaluate postoperative healing of patients undergoing laser resurfacing compared with the traditional modalities of chemical peels and dermabrasion. design: a 3-part study was designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new modality. cutaneous tissue from patients undergoing rhytidectomy was treated with a carbon dioxide laser with the cpg varying the treatment parameters. a histological analysis was completed to evaluate the uniformity of tissue ablation and thermal effect. next, 30 tissue specimens were treated with identical power settings and evaluated histologically to determine the depth of tissue ablation, the variability in depth of ablation, and the degree of thermal effect on the underlying dermis. finally, a prospective clinical analysis of patients undergoing facial resurfacing with the carbon dioxide laser was undertaken to determine the length of time required for reepithelialization, as well as resolution of postresurfacing erythema. patients: seventy-four patients underwent facial resurfacing with a carbon dioxide laser with cpg. sixty patients were treated for cosmetic procedures and 14 were treated for either chronic acne scarring or posttraumatic scarring. interventions: to evaluate the cpg parameters, skin specimens were treated with the same fluence while the density setting varied from 1 through 9. to evaluate tissue uniformity and thermal effect, the cpg was used with the same treatment parameters of 300 mj and a density of 5 for all specimens. patients undergoing clinical evaluation were treated for periorbital, perioral, or full face resurfacing. all patients were treated by the same surgeon. main outcome measures: histological specimens were evaluated with light microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin staining to determine the depth and uniformity of ablation and the thermal effect. patients were followed up after the procedure and evaluated for complete reepithelialization and resolution of erythema. results: a histological evaluation revealed that a treatment parameter of 300 mj with a density setting of 3,4, or 5 resulted in uniform ablation of the epidermis with minimal thermal injury to the underlying dermis. at density settings of 1 and 2, irregular ablation of the tissue occurred, while at a density setting of 6 through 9, increasing degrees of thermal injury and tissue necrosis occurred. the depth of epithelial ablation with density set at 5 varied between 65 and 90 pm (average depth, 78 米m). the thermal effect in the papillary dermis varied between 0 and 45 pm (average, 28 pm). no tissue necrosis was seen. complete reepithelialization occurred an average of 7 days following the procedure, with resolution of cutaneous erythema occurring at an average of 42 days. conclusions: the carbon dioxide laser with the cpg is an effective modality for cutaneous exfoliation. with the proper treatment parameters, extreme accuracy and uniformity of tissue ablation can be achieved. the tissue is ablated with micrometer accuracy and minimal thermal effect to the underlying dermis. postoperative healing is comparable to that of the traditional modalities of

"oromandibular reconstruction with the fibular free flap: analysis of 50 consecutive flaps. objective: to evaluate the results and functional outcome associated with fibular free flap reconstruction of orofacial and mandibular defects. design: we conducted a retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive fibular free flaps during a 3-year period. forty patients were available for follow-up, which ranged from 4 to 39 months. setting: academic tertiary care referral medical center. patients: fifty consecutive mandibular reconstructions using the fibular free flap were performed on 47 patients. thirty-five patients (74%) underwent primary reconstruction. sixty-six percent of the mandibular defects were anterior or combined anterolateral types; the remainder were pure lateral defects. in 38 patients (81%), a skin paddle was included with the flap to provide either a mucosal lining or skin cover, whereas in only 9 patients (19%), bone was used alone. main outcome measures: factors reflecting functional properties and processes as well as complications of the upper aerodigestive tract were evaluated clinically and radiographically. results: four flaps required reexploration as emergencies, and none were successfully salvaged (8.5% failure). three patients underwent further free vascularized fibula transfer with 1 failure. during follow-up, swallowing was normal in 25 patients (64%), oral continence was normal or almost normal in 26 patients (67%), and speech was normal or easily intelligible in 35 patients (90%). aesthetic results were excellent or acceptable in 37 patients (95%). conclusions: our results reveal that the vascularized fibular free flap is very suitable with an excellent success rate for reconstructing both the composite or simple long-spanned mandibular defect. the overlying skin island is reliable and provides lining or coverage for intraoral and extraoral defects. superior functional and cosmetic results are expected in the majority of patients, while donor site morbidity is minimal.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:939-944",fibular free flap;;mandibular defects;;superior functional and cosmetic results;;consecutive fibular free flaps;;mucosal lining or skin cover;;fibular free flap reconstruction;;orofacial and mandibular defects;;vascularized fibular free flap;;intraoral and extraoral defects;;functional properties and processes;;fifty consecutive mandibular reconstructions;;simple long-spanned mandibular defect;;free vascularized fibula transfer;;donor site morbidity;;pure lateral defects;;excellent success rate,"oromandibular reconstruction with the fibular free flap: analysis of 50 consecutive flaps.;;objective: to evaluate the results and functional outcome associated with fibular free flap reconstruction of orofacial and mandibular defects.;;design: we conducted a retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive fibular free flaps during a 3-year period.;;forty patients were available for follow-up, which ranged from 4 to 39 months.;;setting: academic tertiary care referral medical center.;;patients: fifty consecutive mandibular reconstructions using the fibular free flap were performed on 47 patients.;;thirty-five patients (74%) underwent primary reconstruction.;;sixty-six percent of the mandibular defects were anterior or combined anterolateral types;

"validity of clinic biopsy specimens in classifying histopathologic characteristics of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. objective: to evaluate nasopharyngeal carcinoma resection specimens for heterogeneity of histologic patterns to determine if preoperative histologic characteristics of the clinic biopsy specimen are representative of the entire lesion. the null hypothesis is that clinic biopsy specimens are not necessarily representative. design: preoperative clinic biopsy specimens were measured to calculate their average size. resection specimens were then sectioned and evaluated in increments corresponding to this size. each of these increments was then histologically classified according to the world health organization (who) criteria. this classification of the preoperative biopsy specimens was compared with that of the resection specimen as a whole. setting: university referral center. patients: twenty-six consecutive patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent surgical resection. radiation therapy failed in all patients. main outcome measure: the presence or absence of who histologic heterogeneity in the nasopharyngectomy specimen was recorded. disparity between preoperative clinic biopsy and resection specimens was recorded. results: the mean clinic biopsy specimen size was 13.9 mm2 or less than 1% of the available surface area of the nasopharynx. of 26 resection specimens classified in 5 increments of this size, 15 (57.7%) were a single who type, and 11(42.3%) were found to be mixtures of who types i, ii, and iii. of 16 cases with preoperative biopsy specimens available, 4 (25%) were a different who classification than their corresponding resection specimen. conclusions: most clinic biopsy specimens were representative of their corresponding tumor resection specimens in their entirety; however, tumor heterogeneity is such that some biopsy specimens will not be representative. this finding may interfere with who classification data determined on the basis of clinic biopsy specimens and hence confound any meaningful data on treatment outcomes. it is recommended then that multiple nasopharyngeal biopsy specimens be obtained from disparate areas of the lesion and each subjected to independent histopathologic review.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:950-955",biopsy specimens;;clinic biopsy specimen;;resection specimen;;clinic biopsy specimens;;resection specimens;;recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma;;preoperative clinic biopsy;;preoperative biopsy specimens;;increments;;mean clinic biopsy specimen size;;nasopharyngeal carcinoma resection specimens;;multiple nasopharyngeal biopsy specimens;;preoperative clinic biopsy specimens;;corresponding tumor resection specimens;;preoperative histologic characteristics;;world health organization,"validity of clinic biopsy specimens in classifying histopathologic characteristics of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.;;objective: to evaluate nasopharyngeal carcinoma resection specimens for heterogeneity of histologic patterns to determine if preoperative histologic characteristics of the clinic biopsy specimen are representative of the entire lesion.;;the null hypothesis is that clinic biopsy specimens are not necessarily representative.;;design: preoperative clinic biopsy specimens were measured to calculate their average size.;;resection specimens were then sectioned and evaluated in increments corresponding to this size.;;each of these increments was then histologically classified according to the world health organization (who) criteria.;;this classification of the preoperative biopsy specimens was compared with that of the resection specimen as a whole.;;setting: university referral center.;;patients: twenty-six consecutive patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent surgical resection.;;radiation therapy failed in all patients.;;main outcome measure: the presence or absence of who histologic heterogeneity in the nasopharyngectomy specimen was recorded.;;disparity between preoperative clinic biopsy and resection specimens was recorded.;;results: the mean clinic biopsy specimen size was 13.9 mm2 or less than 1% of the available surface area of the nasopharynx.;;of 26 resection specimens classified in 5 increments of this size, 15 (57.7%) were a single who type, and 11(42.3%) were found to be mixtures of who types i, ii, and iii.;;of 16 cases with preoperative biopsy specimens available, 4 (25%) were a different who classification than their corresponding resection specimen.;;conclusions: most clinic biopsy specimens were representative of their corresponding tumor resection specimens in their entirety;

"submucosal tumor extension in hypopharyngeal cancer. objectives: to study the incidence and extent of submucosal tumor extension in hypopharyngeal cancer and to evaluate the impact on the tumor recurrence and overall survival rates. method: fifty-seven resected specimens of hypopharyngeal cancer were studied in detail from january 1986 to december 1989 by use of the whole-organ, step〞serial sectioning technique. results: three types of submucosal tumor extension could be identified. type i extension was characterized by a tumor with a smooth round contour that extended submucosally. the mucosa was thereby elevated and was detectable on gross inspection at operation. in type ii extension, tongues and islands of tumor infiltrated within the submucosa, and these were not noticeable on gross examination. skip metastasis in the submucosa where the submucosal tumor was completely separated from the main tumor bulk was classified as type iii extension. thirty-three patients (58%) had submucosal tumor extension. the frequencies (and extents of submucosal tumor extension) in the superior, medial, lateral, and inferior directions were 16% (3-10 mm), 37% (2-37 mm), 26% (2-37 mm), and 28% (3-35 mm), respectively. two thirds of the submucosal extension was type i (22 of 33), and only 1 patient had a true skip lesion submucosally (type iii extension). type ii submucosal extension was found in one third of the patients (11 of 33). this occurred significantly more often in the patients who had received radiotherapy before surgery (82% 9/11];

"cytokine expression in otitis media with effusion: tumor necrosis factor soluble receptor. background: a variety of cytokines, such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), appear to play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases, including chronic otitis media with effusion (come). recently, cytokine inhibitors have been isolated and are presumed to regulate the proinflammatory effects of these cytokines. this has lead us to hypothesize that the chronic inflammation seen in come is the result of an imbalance in the ratio of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibitors that favors the proinflammatory cytokines. design: middle ear effusions were evaluated for the cytokine tnf-汐 and the inhibitor tnf soluble receptor (tnfsolr) using a combination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and radioactive immunoassays. we determined the presence and quantified the amounts of tnf-汐 and tnfsolr and correlated this result with clinical parameters in patients with come. setting: university hospital. patients: to test this hypothesis, 35 middle ear effusions were obtained from 29 children aged 2 to 102 months (mean, 39.6 months) undergoing tympanostomy tube insertion for come. outcome: children were followed up for at least 12 months postoperatively and the number of subsequent episodes of otitis media correlated with cytokine levels. results: the tnf-汐 and tnfsolr were present in 83% and 91% of effusions, respectively. the tnf-汐 mean (㊣sem) cytokine values were 110.6㊣32.1 pg/mg of total protein, and 12 886㊣3108 pg/mg total protein for tnfsolr. analysis of correlations in a univariate model revealed a statistically significant relationship for tnf-汐 correlated with tnfsolr (r2=0.463; p<.001). the tnf-汐 levels were significantly lower for children with multiple tube insertions (p=.02). higher levels of tnf-汐 were noted in those children who subsequently developed episodes of otitis media after tube placement (p=.02). the ratio of tnf-汐 to tnfsolr, the mean (㊣sem) inhibitor index, was 430㊣220 u. conclusions: our data support the hypothesis that cytokines and their inhibitors are present in a large number of middle ear effusions and in part are likely important in the regulation of inflammatory processes in come.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:984-988",otitis media;;tnfsolr;;middle ear effusions;;tumor necrosis factor;;total protein;;proinflammatory cytokines;;effusions;;tumor necrosis factor soluble receptor;;proinflammatory cytokines and inhibitors;;inhibitor tumor necrosis factor soluble receptor;;chronic otitis media;;statistically significant relationship;;tympanostomy tube insertion;;enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays;;multiple tube insertions,"cytokine expression in otitis media with effusion: tumor necrosis factor soluble receptor.;;background: a variety of cytokines, such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), appear to play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory response in a variety of diseases, including chronic otitis media with effusion (come).;;recently, cytokine inhibitors have been isolated and are presumed to regulate the proinflammatory effects of these cytokines.;;this has lead us to hypothesize that the chronic inflammation seen in come is the result of an imbalance in the ratio of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibitors that favors the proinflammatory cytokines.;;design: middle ear effusions were evaluated for the cytokine tnf-汐 and the inhibitor tnf soluble receptor (tnfsolr) using a combination of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and radioactive immunoassays.;;we determined the presence and quantified the amounts of tnf-汐 and tnfsolr and correlated this result with clinical parameters in patients with come.;;setting: university hospital.;;patients: to test this hypothesis, 35 middle ear effusions were obtained from 29 children aged 2 to 102 months (mean, 39.6 months) undergoing tympanostomy tube insertion for come.;;outcome: children were followed up for at least 12 months postoperatively and the number of subsequent episodes of otitis media correlated with cytokine levels.;;results: the tnf-汐 and tnfsolr were present in 83% and 91% of effusions, respectively.;;the tnf-汐 mean (㊣sem) cytokine values were 110.6㊣32.1 pg/mg of total protein, and 12 886㊣3108 pg/mg total protein for tnfsolr.;;analysis of correlations in a univariate model revealed a statistically significant relationship for tnf-汐 correlated with tnfsolr (r2=0.463;

"antioxidant activity of rat parotid saliva. background: the healing-promotion property of saliva has been observed in the past, but its underlying mechanism has never been elucidated. we hypothesized a mechanism based on salivary proteins binding to redox active metal ions, rendering them nonactive in their capacity for free radical production. methods: examination of this mechanism was conducted by comparing the redox activity of protein-rich saliva with protein-poor saliva. we also examined the redox activity mediated by these 2 kinds of saliva following the in vitro addition of iron, copper, and manganese. saliva samples were analyzed for their redox activity by measuring the ascorbate-driven and saliva (diluted 1:2)-mediated conversion of salicylate to its 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoates and catechol metabolites. results: the concentrations of salicylate metabolites formed by protein-rich saliva were significantly lower by 45% (p<.05), 66% (p<.01), and 54% (p<.05), respectively, when compared with those formed by proteinpoor saliva. the capacity of saliva in suppressing redox activity was found to be inversely related to the concentrations of iron and copper added (but not manganese), but correlated well with the protein content. when the highest concentrations of iron (15 米mol/l) and copper (10 米mol/l) were added to protein-rich saliva, the concentrations of salicylate metabolites produced were only 0.3% to 1% of those of non〞saliva-containing controls (p<.01). however, when these concentrations of iron and copper were added to protein-poor saliva, significantly higher values of redox activity were detected, and the concentrations of the salicylate derivatives produced were 2.1% to 8.1% of those of non〞saliva-containing controls (p<.01). in contrast, when the lowest concentrations of iron (2 米mol/l) and copper (0.1 米mol/l) were added, 2.8 to 4 times lower concentrations of salicylate derivatives were produced

"in vitro growth suppression by adenoviral transduction of p21 and p16 in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a research model for combination gene therapy. objectives to determine the duration of expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 and p16 and the effect of these 2 genes both alone and in combination on the growth of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines in vitro. experimental methods and design cells were transduced via an adenoviral vector with p21 (ad5cmv-p21), p16 (ad5cmv-p16), or both. western blotting was performed to determine duration of expression of the protein products of the transduced p21 and p16 genes. in vitro growth assays and cell cycle analyses were performed on transduced cells. results transduced gene products were detected up to day 12 after infection. western blotting showed high levels of p21 and p16 in transduced cells. growth suppression was observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines transduced with ad5cmv-p21, ad5cmv-p16, or both, but the combination of p21 and p16 did not achieve significantly greater growth suppression than that seen in cells transduced with ad5cmv-p16 alone. cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the percentage of cells arrested at g1 stage in the cells transduced with ad5cmv-p16 was similar to that in the cells transduced with both ad5cmv-p21 and ad5cmv-p16. no significant in vivo growth suppression was observed in tumor nodules treated with ad5cmv-p16. conclusions although p21 and p16 are believed to function as cell cycle regulators of cyclin-dependent kinases, we observed no additive or synergistic effect when using them in combination. the expression of transduced p21 and p16 gene products up to days 9 and 12, respectively, was consistent with the growth suppression and cell cycle arrest observed. this work provides information on the previously uncharacterized duration of p21 and p16 transgene product expression and also

"tumor angiogenesis and p53 mutations: prognosis in head and neck cancer. objectives to assess how p53 gene mutations and microvessel density (mvd) may be used as prognostic markers for the study and management of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and to investigate putative associations between p53 gene mutations and mvd and the relationship of these factors to tumor response to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy at 6 weeks. patients and design thirty-nine patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, stages i to iv, who were examined at rush-presbyterian-st luke's medical center, chicago, ill, and its affiliated hospitals between 1993 and 1995 were monitored. mutations in the p53 gene were identified by microdissection of tumor cells on frozen sections, followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the products of polymerase chain reaction amplification of exons 5 to 9. the microvessels were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies to factor viii and/or cd31. microvessel counts were done by 2 investigators blinded to each other's counts and to the p53 gene status. intratumoral or peritumoral microvascular ""hot spots"" were assessed and

"clinical role of soluble adhesion molecules during immunotherapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. background soluble forms of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sicam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (svcam-1) have recently been identified in serum samples from atopic patients, but their clinical significance in the treatment of allergic diseases remains to be established. objective to study the clinical roles of serum sicam-1 and svcam-1 during immunotherapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. design our study included 30 nonatopic volunteers and 60 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis due to dermatophagoides farinae. the 60 patients had been treated for variable periods (7.3㊣3.0 years [mean㊣sd]) with immunotherapy using a standardized d farinae antigen. serum samples were collected from each patient before and after immunotherapy to determine sicam-1 and svcam-1 with sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. results serum levels of sicam-1 in the patients before immunotherapy were higher than those in the nonatopic volunteers (p<.001). the levels of sicam-1 in the patients' serum samples were decreased significantly after immunotherapy (p<.001), and the percentage of the decrease in the sicam-1 levels was significantly correlated with the duration of immunotherapy (p=.04) and with the percentage of the decrease in symptom scores (p<.001). the levels

simultaneous free flaps were transferred to achieve an optimal bone and soft tissue reconstruction. endosteal dental implants were used in 81 patients, with a total of 360 fixtures placed during these 11 years. main outcome measures the success of microvascular free tissue transfer, dental implant extrusion, and short- and long-term complications at the recipient and donor sites. results of the 210 mandibular reconstructions that were performed, 202 were successful in reestablishing mandibular continuity. reexploration for vascular-related complications was done in 16 patients, 8 of whom were successfully treated, yielding an overall success rate of 96%. the overall success rate for endosteal dental implants was 92%. the implant success rate was 86% when the bone in which the fixtures were placed was irradiated postoperatively. the success rate was 64% in the 14 fixtures that were placed into previously irradiated bone. conclusions the success of the use of vascularized bone free flaps in restoring continuity to the mandible is clearly demonstrated in this series. there was an acceptable incidence of donor- and recipient-site complications that resulted in minimal long-term morbidity. the careful selection of a donor site(s) for oromandibular reconstruction allows for an optimal restoration of bony and soft tissue defects. dental implants can be safely used in oromandibular reconstruction with a high level of success. placing these implants during the initial surgery shortens the duration for achieving dental rehabilitation and enhances the success of the

statistical analysis was performed by the fisher exact test. main outcome measures a positive test result corresponded to water entering the middle ear via the tt, confirmed by a resistance reading of zero on the ohmmeter. a negative test result indicated no change in the initial high resistance reading. results no positive test results were obtained for showering (0 of 60 tests), hair rinsing (0 of 60 tests), or head submersion (12.7 cm) in clean tap water (0 of 60 tests). ten positive test results were obtained for head submersion in soapy water (10 of 97 tests), which was statistically different from clean water (p≒.007). swimming pool depths of 30, 45, 60, and 75 cm elicited positive test results in 2 of 16, 3 of 18, 2 of 20, and 11 of 20 tests, respectively. a higher incidence of water entry into the middle ear occurred at depths of more than 60 cm (p≒.001). no statistical difference between depths of 60 cm or less occurred (p=.88). conclusions showering, hair rinsing, and head submersion in clean tap water do not promote water entry into the middle ear. submersion in soapy water increases the probability of water contamination. pool water infrequently enters the middle ear with head submersion, but the incidence increases with deeper swimming (>60 cm). these data provide further evidence that many water precautions frequently advised in patients with tts are unnecessary.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:1118-1121-->",middle ear;;positive test result;;positive test results;;water exposure;;water entry;;hair rinsing;;submersion;;clean tap

"sensory recovery in noninnervated radial forearm free flaps in oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction. background reinnerveration of free flaps used in oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction may provide a high level of sensory return. spontaneous recovery of sensation in noninnervated flaps may also occur. objective to evaluate the extent of spontaneous sensory return among patients who underwent radial forearm free flap reconstruction in the oral cavity and oropharynx. methods a total of 40 patients were evaluated by 2 independent examiners. the median patient age was 60 years, and the median time from surgery was 47 months. a total of 29 patients had received postoperative radiotherapy. the mean flap size was 25 cm2. the following sensory modalities were tested: light touch, pinprick, hot and cold, and moving and static 2-point discrimination. results recovery of sensation of at least 1 modality was noted in 32 patients (80%), however, only 5 patients (13%) had return of all 5 modalities. eight patients (20%) had no sensory return. there was a trend to improved sensory recovery in flaps placed in the alveolar and retromolar trigone areas; however, on multivariate analysis, sensory return could not be predicted by any of the following factors: patient age, flap site, flap size, length of follow-up, and use of postoperative radiotherapy. conclusions complete sensory recovery was uncommon, unpredictable, and variable, although some recovery of sensation occurred in 80% of patients. it is not valid to rely on spontaneous sensory recovery for sensory innervation of free flaps. correlation of sensory return with function is still needed.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:1206-1208-->",sensory return;;sensory recovery;;free flaps;;oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction;;oropharyngeal reconstruction;;postoperative radiotherapy;;flap size;;patient age;;flaps;;noninnervated radial forearm free flaps;;alveolar and retromolar trigone areas;;radial forearm free flap reconstruction;;oral cavity and oropharynx;;conclusions complete sensory recovery;;following sensory modalities;;complete sensory recovery,"sensory recovery in noninnervated radial forearm free flaps in oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction.;;background reinnerveration of free flaps used in oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction may provide a high level of sensory return.;;spontaneous recovery of sensation in noninnervated flaps may also occur.;;objective to evaluate the extent of spontaneous sensory return among patients who underwent radial forearm free flap reconstruction in the oral cavity and oropharynx.;;methods a total of 40 patients were evaluated by 2 independent examiners.;;the median patient age was 60 years, and the median time from surgery was 47 months.;;a total of 29 patients had received postoperative radiotherapy.;;the mean flap size was 25 cm2.;;the following sensory modalities were tested: light touch, pinprick, hot and cold, and moving and static 2-point discrimination.;;results recovery of sensation of at least 1 modality was noted in 32 patients (80%), however, only 5 patients (13%) had return of all 5 modalities.;;eight patients (20%) had no sensory return.;;there was a trend to improved sensory recovery in flaps placed in the alveolar and retromolar trigone areas; however, on multivariate analysis, sensory return could not be predicted by any of the following factors: patient age, flap site, flap size, length of follow-up, and use of postoperative radiotherapy.;;conclusions complete sensory recovery was uncommon, unpredictable, and variable, although some recovery of sensation occurred in 80% of patients.;;it is not valid to rely on spontaneous sensory recovery for sensory innervation of free flaps.;;correlation of sensory return with function is still needed.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1998;124:1206-1208-->",noninnervated radial forearm free flaps;;sensory modalities;;forearm free flap reconstruction;;sensory return;;trend;;underwent;;light touch;;noninnervated flaps;;sensation;;years;;spontaneous sensory return;;postoperative radiotherapy;;spontaneous sensory recovery;;median patient age;;total;;surgery;;methods;;multivariate analysis;;recovery;;conclusions;;spontaneous recovery;;modalities;;mean flap size;;modality;;oropharynx;;eight patients;;objective;;length;;oral cavity;;independent examiners;;function;;return;;sensory recovery;;oropharyngeal reconstruction;;results;;flap size;;static 2-point discrimination;;needed.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;extent;;following factors;;median time;;retromolar trigone areas;;high level;;cm2;;months;;pinprick;;background reinnerveration;;sensory innervation;;patients;;flaps;;correlation;;free flaps;;flap site;;patient age
"comparison of subperiosteal vs subgaleal elevation techniques used in forehead lifts. objectives to compare eyebrow and forehead elevation and tension among the following 3 surgical techniques: subperiosteal dissection to the supraorbital rim, subperiosteal dissection with release (elevation, incision, and spread) of periosteum at the supraorbital rim, and subgaleal dissection to the supraorbital rim, and to determine the optimal method of elevation in an aesthetically accepted range for the endoscopic forehead lift. design a randomized, self-controlled study using an open approach to the forehead in cadaver heads. each half of head was compared with the other in the following 2 study groups: subperiosteal dissection without release vs subperiosteal dissection with release of periosteum (group 1) and subperiosteal dissection with release of periosteum vs subgaleal dissection. setting anatomy laboratory at a university medical center. subjects eight cadaver heads fixed with ethylene glycol in each group. intervention predissection distances in millimeters from fixed anatomic landmarks were measured. the forehead flaps were elevated using a coronal incision and divided with a midline incision for side-to-side comparison. cadaver heads and side of surgical intervention were selected randomly. the flap tensions associated with incremental flap advancement of 0.5 and 1.0 cm were measured. traction of 2.2 kg was then applied to each flap, and distances between the fixed landmarks were measured. main outcome measures mean predissection and postdissection distance of brow and forehead elevation for each dissection type and mean distance and median tension of brow and forehead elevation within each group. results the mean postdissection brow measurements at rest were significantly greater than the mean predissection measurements at most landmarks in all dissections for both groups (p<.05). the mean postdissection brow and forehead measurements with 2.2 kg of traction were significantly greater than the mean predissection measurements at all landmarks in all dissections for both groups (p<.05). the mean increase in distance from

"in vitro growth suppression by adenoviral transduction of p21 and p16 in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a research model for combination gene therapy. objectives to determine the duration of expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 and p16 and the effect of these 2 genes both alone and in combination on the growth of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines in vitro. experimental methods and design cells were transduced via an adenoviral vector with p21 (ad5cmv-p21), p16 (ad5cmv-p16), or both. western blotting was performed to determine duration of expression of the protein products of the transduced p21 and p16 genes. in vitro growth assays and cell cycle analyses were performed on transduced cells. results transduced gene products were detected up to day 12 after infection. western blotting showed high levels of p21 and p16 in transduced cells. growth suppression was observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines transduced with ad5cmv-p21, ad5cmv-p16, or both, but the combination of p21 and p16 did not achieve significantly greater growth suppression than that seen in cells transduced with ad5cmv-p16 alone. cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the percentage of cells arrested at g1 stage in the cells transduced with ad5cmv-p16 was similar to that in the cells transduced with both ad5cmv-p21 and ad5cmv-p16. no significant in vivo growth suppression was observed in tumor nodules treated with ad5cmv-p16. conclusions although p21 and p16 are believed to function as cell cycle regulators of cyclin-dependent kinases, we observed no additive or synergistic effect when using them in combination. the expression of transduced p21 and p16 gene products up to days 9 and 12, respectively, was

"clinical role of soluble adhesion molecules during immunotherapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. background soluble forms of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sicam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (svcam-1) have recently been identified in serum samples from atopic patients, but their clinical significance in the treatment of allergic diseases remains to be established. objective to study the clinical roles of serum sicam-1 and svcam-1 during immunotherapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. design our study included 30 nonatopic volunteers and 60 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis due to dermatophagoides farinae. the 60 patients had been treated for variable periods (7.3㊣3.0 years [mean㊣sd]) with immunotherapy using a standardized d farinae antigen. serum samples were collected from each patient before and after immunotherapy to determine sicam-1 and svcam-1 with sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. results serum levels of sicam-1 in the patients before immunotherapy were higher than those in the nonatopic volunteers (p<.001). the levels of sicam-1 in the patients' serum samples were decreased significantly after immunotherapy (p<.001), and the percentage of the decrease in the sicam-1 levels was significantly correlated with the duration of immunotherapy (p=.04) and with the percentage of the decrease in symptom scores (p<.001). the levels of svcam-1 in the serum samples from the patients with severe symptoms were significantly higher before immunotherapy than those in the nonatopic volunteers (p=.002) and were significantly decreased after immunotherapy (p=.05). however, the percentage of the decrease in the svcam-1 levels was not correlated with the duration of immunotherapy (p=.89) or with the percentage of the decrease in symptom scores (p=.89). conclusion decrease in serum sicam-1 levels during immunotherapy is probably involved in the working mechanisms of immunotherapy, but modulation of serum svcam-1 levels is not

"septal perforation repair with acellular human dermal allograft. background connective tissue autografts are commonly used as interpositional grafts between septal flaps in the repair of septal perforations. the most common graft materials used include temporalis fascia and pericranium, both of which are accompanied by donor site morbidity, do not provide septal bulk, and are exceedingly thin and difficult to manage. objective to study the use of an acellular human dermal allograft (alloderm, lifecell corp, the woodlands, tex) as a connective tissue interpositional graft in septal perforation repair. setting private facial plastic surgery and reconstructive practice of 1 of the authors (r.w.h.k.), houston, tex, and the private and university practice of another author (h.f.), alexandria, egypt. patients twelve consecutive patients with septal perforation who received the acellular dermal allograft constituted this evaluation. the causes of the septal perforations were previous nasal surgery, previous nasal cautery, or cocaine use by the patient. design interposition grafting between mucoperichondrial flaps for septal perforation repair was accomplished with decellularized human dermal grafts. follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 14 months. main outcome measures the repair was considered successful when, on postoperative examination at 3 months, the right and left mucoperichondrial flaps were entirely healed. from the experience of 1 author (r.w.h.k.) with the repair of more than 75 septal perforations, no perforation that was healed at 3 months broke down at a later date, unless trauma or cocaine use occurred after the operation. an outcome was considered acceptable but nondesirable if a perforation was still present after the operation but the number and severity of the patient's symptoms were reduced and the perforation was considerably smaller than before the operation. results eleven of the 12 patients had successful outcomes with complete closure of their perforations. the 1 remaining patient had an acceptable result but incomplete closure;

"hydroxyapatite cement in craniofacial skeletal reconstruction and its effects on the developing craniofacial skeleton. objective to assess the effects of hydroxyapatite cement (hac) on the developing feline craniofacial skeleton. design fronto-orbital craniotomies were performed on 14 kittens and reconstructed by autograft or hac. by design, animals in which the craniofacial skeleton was reconstructed with hac also underwent obliteration of the left frontal sinus. after achievement of skeletal maturity, animals were sacrificed and compared by 11 standardized cranial measurements obtained by sliding caliper. additional analyses included histological studies, histomorphometry, and computed tomography. subjects twenty-one 12-week-old female cats were divided into 3 groups, composed of 7 specimens. intervention the control animals underwent periosteal elevation alone (group 1). the remaining animals underwent unilateral fronto-orbital craniotomy and subsequent reconstruction with orthotopic bone flap replacement (group 2) or hac (group 3). results all animals survived the study with no evidence of wound infection or implant failure. gross morphological studies demonstrated excellent contour reconstruction in both experimental groups. craniometric analysis detected 1 intergroup difference that consisted of a wider skull in group 3 on the reconstructed side. an intragroup difference in orbital height was also seen in group 3. computed tomography demonstrated a solid appearance of the implant with obliteration of the left frontal sinus in group 3. histological studies showed that hac was osseointegrated to native bone, with areas of new bone interspersed throughout the implants. no significant inflammatory response or fibrous encapsulation was noted. histomorphometry demonstrated that implants were replaced by osseous tissue in 44% to 50% of the animals within 5 months. conclusion hydroxyapatite cement is safe and

p=.001, mann-whitney u test). twenty-two children (25%) in group 1 required airway management or observation in the pediatric intensive care unit compared with no children in group 2 who required such care (p<.001, fisher exact test). none of the children in either group required reintubation, continuous positive airway pressure, or tracheotomy. respiratory complications requiring intervention were 5 times more likely in group 1 (22 [25] vs 3 [5];

"localization of regional lymph nodes in melanomas of the head and neck. objectives to study the efficacy of gamma-probe radiolocalization of the first draining (sentinel) lymph node (sln) in stage n0 melanoma of the head and neck and to evaluate its potential role in the staging and treatment of this disease. design gamma-probe radiolocalization, a new alternative to blue-dye lymphatic mapping, uses a scintillation (gamma) probe to identify radiolabeled slns. in a consecutive sample clinical trial, gamma-probe radiolocalization of the sln is compared with lymphoscintigraphy and blue-dye lymphatic mapping. follow-ups ranged from 1.7 years to 4 years, with a mean follow-up of 2.5 years. setting tertiary and private care teaching hospital. patients between june 1993 and november 1995, 23 patients with stage n0 intermediate-thickness melanoma of the head and neck were enrolled in this volunteer sample. interventions twenty-four hours prior to surgery, a radioactive tracer was intradermally injected around the circumference of a primary melanoma. twelve patients also had blue dye injected just prior to surgical resection. using a handheld gamma probe, radiolabeled lymph nodes were identified and selectively removed with minimal dissection. in patients with nodes with histologic evidence of metastases, a regional lymphadenectomy was performed. main outcome measures the successful identification of radiolabeled slns, the correlation of sln radiolabeling to lymphoscintigraphy and blue-dye mapping, and the long-term development of regional metastases. results surgeons successfully resected the radiolabeled slns in 22 (96%) of 23 patients. the success rate of blue-dye lymphatic mapping was 8 (75%) of 12 patients and lymphoscintigraphy was 20 (91%) of 22

"the use of 3-dimensional models in auricular reconstruction. reconstruction of the microtic auricle is a difficult process requiring considerable experience and dedication to detail. it is a multistage proposition requiring the talents of both the reconstructive surgeon and the otologic surgeon. reconstruction of the external ear usually precedes the reconstruction of the middle ear. often, a template is used by the reconstructive surgeon to aid in this complicated process. traditionally, templates used by the reconstructive surgeon have been 2 dimensional (usually x-ray paper) and made from the opposite normal ear or another normal ear in cases of bilateral microtia. use of a 2-dimensional model only provides a rough estimate of the cartilage framework needed. considerable experience is therefore needed to get this cartilage framework ""just right."" we have developed a number of 3-dimensional synthetic templates to aid in the creation of an accurate cartilage framework implant. these templates serve as a more accurate guide in the complex cartilage carving and assembly process. the use of 3-dimensional templates has improved our technical reconstructive results in a small number of patients. we present these results and propose future application of these ideas.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:335-338-->",reconstructive surgeon;;cartilage framework;;considerable experience;;normal ear;;templates;;considerable experience and dedication;;accurate cartilage framework implant;;complex cartilage carving;;3-dimensional synthetic templates;;opposite normal ear;;technical reconstructive results;;microtic auricle;;3-dimensional models;;difficult process;;auricular reconstruction;;middle ear;;2-dimensional model,"the use of 3-dimensional models in auricular reconstruction.;;reconstruction of the microtic auricle is a difficult process requiring considerable experience and dedication to detail.;;it is a multistage proposition requiring the talents of both the reconstructive surgeon and the otologic surgeon.;;reconstruction of the external ear usually precedes the reconstruction of the middle ear.;;often, a template is used by the reconstructive surgeon to aid in this complicated process.;;traditionally, templates used by the reconstructive surgeon have been 2 dimensional (usually x-ray paper) and made from the opposite normal ear or another normal ear in cases of bilateral microtia.;;use of a 2-dimensional model only provides a rough estimate of the cartilage framework needed.;;considerable experience is therefore needed to get this cartilage framework ""just right.;;"" we have developed a number of 3-dimensional synthetic templates to aid in the creation of an accurate cartilage framework implant.;;these templates serve as a more accurate guide in the complex cartilage carving and assembly process.;;the use of 3-dimensional templates has improved our technical reconstructive results in a small number of patients.;;we present these results and propose future application of these ideas.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1998;124:335-338-->",middle ear;;process;;2-dimensional model;;creation;;number;;otologic surgeon;;3-dimensional templates;;future application;;complicated process;;use;;technical reconstructive results;;patients;;reconstructive surgeon;;considerable experience;;template;;normal ear;;microtic auricle;;templates;;3-dimensional models;;multistage proposition;;3-dimensional synthetic templates;;x-ray paper;;results;;talents;;dedication;;cases;;small number;;external ear;;reconstruction;;ideas.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;difficult process;;bilateral microtia;;accurate cartilage framework implant;;rough estimate;;auricular reconstruction;;complex cartilage;;dimensional (;;aid;;opposite normal ear;;accurate guide;;cartilage framework

used to treat ias, and successful treatment of ias. results of the 7 patients identified, 3 had isolated posterior glottic stenosis (pgs) and 1 had isolated subglottic stenosis. the other 3 had multiple areas of ias as follows: pgs with bronchial stenosis, supraglottic stenosis with pgs, and tracheomalacia with tracheal stenosis from a suprastomal granuloma. the factors associated with ias were extensive papilloma growth in the posterior glottis, prolonged periods of frequent laryngoscopies, and the use of nonstandard therapies, which in our series included topical podophyllum resin or photodynamic therapy. six patients, all of whom had tracheal rrp at some point in their disease process, required tracheotomy. five patients required laryngotracheal reconstruction. laryngotracheal

of the facial nerve and anomalies is discussed. results anatomically, 3 types of first branchial cleft anomalies are identified: fistulas (n=11), sinuses (n=20), and cysts (n=8). clinically, 3 types of presentation are noted: chronic purulent drainage from the ear (n=12), periauricular swelling in the parotid area (n=18), and abscess or persistent fistula in the neck located above a horizontal

plugging of the superior semicircular canal for treatment of these symptoms. design and setting prospective study of a case series in a tertiary care referral center. patients and results eight patients with vertigo, oscillopsia, and/or disequilibrium related to sound, changes in middle ear pressure, and/or changes in intracranial pressure were identified in a 2-year period. seven of these patients also had vertical-torsional eye movements induced by these sound and/or pressure stimuli. the direction of the evoked eye movements could be explained by excitation or inhibition of the superior semicircular canal in the affected ear. computed tomographic scans of the temporal bones identified dehiscence of bone overlying the affected superior semicircular canal in each case. disabling disequilibrium in 2 patients prompted plugging of the dehiscent superior canal through a middle cranial fossa approach. symptoms were improved in each case. one patient developed recurrent

vestibular symptoms induced by sound in an ear or by changes in middle ear or intracranial pressure. these patients can also experience chronic disequilibrium. eye movements in the plane parallel to that of the superior semicircular canal were evoked by stimuli that have the potential to cause ampullofugal or ampullopetal deflection of this canal's cupula in the presence of a dehiscence of bone

of the facial nerve and anomalies is discussed. results anatomically, 3 types of first branchial cleft anomalies are identified: fistulas (n=11), sinuses (n=20), and cysts (n=8). clinically, 3 types of presentation are noted: chronic purulent drainage from the ear (n=12), periauricular swelling in the parotid area (n=18), and abscess or persistent fistula in the neck located above a horizontal plane passing through the hyoid bone (n=21). a membranous attachment between the floor of the external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane was observed in 10% of cases. the facial nerve was

plugging of the superior semicircular canal for treatment of these symptoms. design and setting prospective study of a case series in a tertiary care referral center. patients and results eight patients with vertigo, oscillopsia, and/or disequilibrium related to sound, changes in middle ear pressure, and/or changes in intracranial pressure were identified in a 2-year period. seven of these patients also had vertical-torsional eye movements induced by these sound and/or pressure stimuli. the direction of the evoked eye movements could be explained by excitation or inhibition of the superior semicircular canal in the affected ear. computed tomographic scans of the temporal bones identified dehiscence of bone overlying the affected superior semicircular canal in each case. disabling disequilibrium in 2 patients prompted plugging of the dehiscent superior canal through a middle cranial fossa approach. symptoms were improved in each case. one patient developed recurrent symptoms requiring an additional plugging procedure and developed sensorineural hearing loss several days after this second procedure. conclusions we have identified patients with a syndrome of vestibular symptoms induced by sound in an ear or by changes in middle ear or intracranial pressure. these patients can also experience chronic disequilibrium. eye movements in the plane parallel to that of the superior semicircular canal were evoked by stimuli that have the potential to cause ampullofugal or ampullopetal deflection of this canal's cupula in the presence of a dehiscence of bone

"effect of pulsed electromagnetic stimulation on facial nerve regeneration. objective to determine if exposure to electromagnetic fields influences regeneration of the transected facial nerve in the rat. design and methods the left facial nerve was transected in the tympanic section of the fallopian canal in 24 rats randomly assigned to 2 groups. the cut ends of the facial nerve were reapproximated without sutures within the fallopian canal to maximize the potential for regeneration. rats in the experimental group (n=12) were then exposed to pulsed electromagnetic stimulation (0.4 millitesla at 120 hz) for 4 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 8 weeks. rats in the control group (n=12) were handled in an identical manner without pulsed electromagnetic stimulation. four other rats were given sham operations in which all surgical procedures were carried out except for the actual nerve transection. two of these rats were placed in each group. nerve regeneration was evaluated using electroneurography (compound action potentials), force of whisker and eyelid movements, and voluntary facial movements before and at 2-week intervals after transection. histological evaluation was performed at 10 weeks after transection. each dependent variable was analyzed using a 2-way analysis of variance with 1 between variable (groups) and 1 within repeated measures variable (days after transection). results statistical analysis indicated that n1 (the negative deflection of depolarization phase of the muscle and/or nerve fibers) area, n1 amplitude, and n1 duration, as well as absolute amplitude of the compound action potentials, were all significantly greater 2 weeks after transection in the experimental than in the control group of rats. the force of eye and whisker movements after electrical stimulation was statistically greater in the experimental group of rats 4 weeks after transection. voluntary eye movements in the experimental group were significantly better at 5 and 10 weeks, while whisker movements were better at 3 and 10 weeks. there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups for any histological variable. conclusion results of this

"the tension wire method: a simple, effective means of mandibular fixation. objective to investigate the use of a tension wire band secured to monocortical screws for open reduction and internal fixation of simple, displaced, and/or unstable mandibular fractures. design retrospective review with follow-up duration of at least 6 weeks. setting level i university trauma center. patients twenty-nine patients (27 males and 2 females), aged 7 to 46 years. ten patients had unilateral fractures (1 patient had 3 separate unilateral fractures) and 19 had bilateral fractures; 34 of 50 fractures were displaced; 19 were open intraorally. the location of fractures and the number (number repaired) were as follows: symphysis or parasymphysis, 13 (10); body, 9 (8); angle, 18 (14); ramus, 6 (4); and subcondylar, 4 (0). two fractures were each comminuted into 3 fragments, and 1 patient had unilateral parasymphysial, body, and ramus fractures. intervention intermaxillary fixation was done in all patients except 1 child. intraoral approaches were used exclusively. a pair of monocortical 2.0-mm screws were placed perpendicular to fracture lines, with 24-gauge wire loops passed around the screws and tightened to bring the fracture into reduction and provide stable fixation. a percutaneous trocar system was used to insert screws at the body, angle, and ramus sites. results there were no instances of infection, malunion, or malocclusion in the 33 fractures repaired with this technique. a typical intermaxillary fixation with open reduction and internal fixation of a posterior fracture was done in less than 2 hours. conclusion open reduction and internal fixation of simple mandibular fractures with tension wire bands around monocortical screws is a simple, quick, and effective technique.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:448-452-->","open reduction;;internal fixation;;screws;;tension wire band;;monocortical screws;;unilateral fractures;;ramus;;separate unilateral fractures;;simple , effective means;;unstable mandibular fractures;;tension wire method;;intervention intermaxillary fixation;;design retrospective review;;percutaneous trocar system","the tension wire method: a simple, effective means of mandibular fixation.;;objective to investigate the use of a tension wire band secured to monocortical screws for open reduction and internal fixation of simple, displaced, and/or unstable mandibular fractures.;;design retrospective review with follow-up duration of at least 6 weeks.;;setting level i university trauma center.;;patients twenty-nine patients (27 males and 2 females), aged 7 to 46 years.;;ten patients had unilateral fractures (1 patient had 3 separate unilateral fractures) and 19 had bilateral fractures; 34 of 50 fractures were displaced; 19 were open intraorally.;;the location of fractures and the number (number repaired) were as follows: symphysis or parasymphysis, 13 (10); body, 9 (8); angle, 18 (14); ramus, 6 (4); and subcondylar, 4 (0).;;two fractures were each comminuted into 3 fragments, and 1 patient had unilateral parasymphysial, body, and ramus fractures.;;intervention intermaxillary fixation was done in all patients except 1 child.;;intraoral approaches were used exclusively.;;a pair of monocortical 2.0-mm screws were placed perpendicular to fracture lines, with 24-gauge wire loops passed around the screws and tightened to bring the fracture into reduction and provide stable fixation.;;a percutaneous trocar system was used to insert screws at the body, angle, and ramus sites.;;results there were no instances of infection, malunion, or malocclusion in the 33 fractures repaired with this technique.;;a typical intermaxillary fixation with open reduction and internal fixation of a posterior fracture was done in less than 2 hours.;;conclusion open reduction and internal fixation of simple mandibular fractures with tension wire bands around monocortical screws is a simple, quick, and effective technique.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1998;124:448-452-->",body;;follow-up duration;;posterior fracture;;intervention intermaxillary fixation;;number;;effective technique.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;years;;instances;;monocortical screws;;design;;screws;;females;;intraoral approaches;;tension wire band;;use;;angle;;stable fixation;;unilateral fractures;;technique;;symphysis;;sites;;percutaneous trocar system;;reduction;;typical intermaxillary fixation;;location;;mandibular fixation;;fracture;;objective;;malocclusion;;weeks;;conclusion;;fractures;;tension wire bands;;patient;;separate unilateral fractures;;effective means;;males;;open reduction;;infection;;results;;hours;;bilateral fractures;;child;;pair;;fragments;;24-gauge wire loops;;and/or unstable mandibular fractures;;internal fixation;;university trauma center;;level;;follows;;malunion;;lines;;parasymphysis;;ramus;;patients;;tension wire method;;simple mandibular fractures;;review
"laryngeal abductor reinnervation with a phrenic nerve transfer after a 9-month delay. background successful restoration of laryngeal abductor function, using the phrenic nerve, has been described in the cat model in the acute phase. however, in clinical practice there is usually a considerable delay between injury to the rln and presentation for treatment. delayed reinnervation therefore would be more suitable in clinical practice. objective to test the feasibility of delayed selective abductor reinnervation following transection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (rln). materials and methods in 12 cats, the right rln was severed. nine months later, the phrenic nerve was anastomosed to the distal rln stump with all its branches directed toward the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. for 10 weeks after the reconstruction, electromyography and videolaryngoscopy were performed weekly. finally, histological analysis of the rln was performed. results evaluation was possible in 11 cats. reinnervation of the right posterior cricoarytenoid muscle with the phrenic nerve occurred in 10 cats following nerve anastomosis, but results of videolaryngoscopy showed adequate to good abduction in only 4 cats. the main limiting factor was reduced mobility of the cricoarytenoid joint. evidence of spontaneous subclinical reinnervation after the delay was observed in 7 cats but apparently did not impede the surgical reinnervation. conclusions delayed selective laryngeal abductor reinnervation was feasible, but function recovery was less successful than if performed immediately. future

"effect of pulsed electromagnetic stimulation on facial nerve regeneration. objective to determine if exposure to electromagnetic fields influences regeneration of the transected facial nerve in the rat. design and methods the left facial nerve was transected in the tympanic section of the fallopian canal in 24 rats randomly assigned to 2 groups. the cut ends of the facial nerve were reapproximated without sutures within the fallopian canal to maximize the potential for regeneration. rats in the experimental group (n=12) were then exposed to pulsed electromagnetic stimulation (0.4 millitesla at 120 hz) for 4 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 8 weeks. rats in the control group (n=12) were handled in an identical manner without pulsed electromagnetic stimulation. four other rats were given sham operations in which all surgical procedures were carried out except for the actual nerve transection. two of these rats were placed in each group. nerve regeneration was evaluated using electroneurography (compound action potentials), force of whisker and eyelid movements, and voluntary facial movements before and at 2-week intervals after transection. histological evaluation was performed at 10 weeks after transection. each dependent variable was analyzed using a 2-way analysis of variance with 1 between variable (groups) and 1 within repeated measures variable (days after transection). results statistical analysis indicated that n1 (the negative deflection of depolarization phase of the muscle and/or nerve fibers) area, n1 amplitude, and n1 duration, as well as absolute amplitude of the compound action potentials, were all significantly greater 2 weeks after transection in the experimental than in the control group of rats. the force of eye and whisker movements after electrical stimulation was statistically greater in the experimental group of rats 4 weeks after transection. voluntary eye movements in the experimental group were significantly better at 5 and 10 weeks, while whisker movements were better at 3 and 10 weeks. there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups for any histological variable. conclusion results of this

"laryngeal abductor reinnervation with a phrenic nerve transfer after a 9-month delay. background successful restoration of laryngeal abductor function, using the phrenic nerve, has been described in the cat model in the acute phase. however, in clinical practice there is usually a considerable delay between injury to the rln and presentation for treatment. delayed reinnervation therefore would be more suitable in clinical practice. objective to test the feasibility of delayed selective abductor reinnervation following transection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (rln). materials and methods in 12 cats, the right rln was severed. nine months later, the phrenic nerve was anastomosed to the distal rln stump with all its branches directed toward the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. for 10 weeks

operative interventions. flow cytometric analysis was performed on the archival paraffin-embedded primary biopsy specimen obtained at the initial surgical excision, providing dna content and percentages of s-phase cells. the investigators who performed the dna analysis were masked to the clinical course. results the age of the patients at presentation ranged from 3 months to 16 years. thirty patients had involvement in more than 1 anatomical site. the disease in 10 patients had spread to the distal tracheobronchial tree. the patients underwent a total of 1124 procedures, with a

"increased mutagen sensitivity in patients with head and neck cancer is less pronounced in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. background mutagen sensitivity tested with bleomycin sulfate can determine a susceptible phenotype, which is relevant only in organs and tissues that have direct contact with the external environment. patients with head and neck cancers have more mutagen sensitivity than control subjects without cancer, and the hypersensitive phenotype has a risk for the development of a second primary cancer. head and neck cancers, however, represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasm. the biological behavior of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) and other head and neck cancers differs. objective to evaluate the difference in mutagen sensitivity among patients without cancer, patients with npc, patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer (orc), and patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer (lhc). design peripheral blood was cultured at 37∼c, using 5% carbon dioxide, for 72 hours. after 67 hours of incubation, bleomycin in a concentration of 30 iu/l was added to induce chromatid breaks. the number of chromatid breaks per cell was scored in 50 metaphases of cultured lymphocytes and compared in the 4 groups. subjects patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the mucosa of the upper digestive tract, which included 3 groups: patients with npc, patients with orc, and those with lhc. control subjects were hospital inpatients with no tumor history. there were 35 patients in each group. results the mean (㊣sd) number of breaks per cell in the control group and in the groups with npc, orc, and lhc were 0.80 (㊣0.32), 1.03 (㊣0.45), 1.30 (㊣0.44), and 1.35 (㊣0.46), respectively. all the cancer groups had significantly higher mean breaks

"the ectopic parathyroid adenoma: a cost justification for routine preoperative localization with technetium tc 99m sestamibi scan. objectives to evaluate the cumulative costs of failure to identify the ectopic parathyroid adenoma when exploration without preoperative localization is performed and to compare these costs with the expenses of routine preoperative localization in every patient. design a consecutive series of 59 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism studied with preoperative scans using technetium tc 99m sestamibi and ultrasound was submitted to a cost analysis. a subset of 5 cases of ectopic adenomas, presumed to be unidentifiable on routine surgery, was similarly analyzed. setting academic tertiary referral center. methods the operative, anesthesia, hospitalization, imaging, and physician reimbursement costs of a failed exploration are compared with the costs of preoperative technetium tc 99m sestamibi and ultrasound scans in every patient. results two cases of mediastinal parathyroid adenomas in this consecutive series of 59 patients were given a theoretical cost, including hospitalization, physician reimbursement, and anesthesia fees. these costs were based on a failed cervical exploration and extracted from the record of an actual patient who underwent such a process at the university of vermont, burlington, in 1995. in addition, the records of 2 patients with intrathyroidal adenomas were submitted to the same theoretical cost analysis with the exception that these patients were assumed to have adenomas that could be discovered after prolonged

"autogenous tissue-engineered cartilage: evaluation as an implant material. objectives to determine whether autogenous tissue-engineered cartilage grafts can be synthesized in predetermined shapes, to compare tissue-engineered cartilage with native cartilage with respect to histological characteristics and biomechanical properties, and to demonstrate how multiple transplantations affect tissue-engineered cartilage. design controlled, prospective animal study. subjects twenty new zealand white rabbits, 3 weeks old. interventions autogenous chondrocytes were seeded onto biodegradable polyglycolic acid每poly-l-lactic acid copolymer templates in 1 of 3 shapes (cross, nasal tip graft, or auricle). grafts and controls of sculpted cartilage were divided among 3 groups: short-term implantation (4 or 8 weeks), long-term implantation (6 or 12 months), and a reimplantation group. the gross morphological features, histological findings, and tensile strength of grafts were assessed. results production of tissue-engineered cartilage was confirmed in 30 of 31 implants. histological evaluation demonstrated characteristic cartilaginous matrix, but with prominent vascular and fibrous tissue ingrowth. in long-term implantation grafts (n=4), foci of osteoid were evident by 6 months. in the subset of transplanted grafts (n=7), 5 of 7 demonstrated significant loss of cartilage viability. tensile strength measurements demonstrated values 24% and 41% of those of controls at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. conclusions tissue-engineered autogenous cartilage can be reliably produced, and predetermination of graft shape is possible. histologically, grafts represent composites of mature cartilage infiltrated by vasculature and fibrous tissue, with delayed osteoid formation. graft viability is compromised by early transplantation, and tensile strength is less than that of native cartilage. these results demonstrate the feasibility of tissue-engineered cartilage

"morphometry of paranasal sinus anatomy in chronic rhinosinusitis: a pilot study. objectives to test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between anatomical variations around the ostiomeatal complex and a predisposition to chronic rhinosinusitis and to define such variations with increased precision. design case-control study of anatomical variations in diseased and normal sinuses. eight homologous landmarks defining the ostiomeatal complex were located on coronal computed tomographic scans, and their x and y coordinates were digitized using image analysis. subjects ten patients with unilateral sinus disease and 10 subjects without sinus disease (scanned for facial pain) who were selected retrospectively by case-note analysis. results logistic regression showed that the only significant spatial change predictive of a person with rhinosinusitis was the vertical position of the middle turbinate (p=.04), although this was not confirmed by wilcoxon testing (p>.10). when examined by sinus, however, the horizontal position of the uncinate process was more laterally placed in persons with rhinosinusitis (p=.01), confirmed on wilcoxon testing (p=.04), but there was no significant difference when compared with sinuses in persons without rhinosinusitis. conclusions our findings suggest that there are no anatomical differences within the ostiomeatal complex between patients with and without rhinosinusitis. patients with rhinosinusitis, however, are more likely to develop it in the side with a more laterally positioned uncinate process. further studies, with more patients and more advanced techniques, including thin-plate spline analysis, are indicated.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:656-658-->",ostiomeatal complex;;rhinosinusitis;;anatomical variations;;chronic rhinosinusitis;;sinus disease;;wilcoxon testing;;uncinate process;;x and y coordinates;;coronal computed tomographic scans;;diseased and normal sinuses;;paranasal sinus anatomy;;unilateral sinus disease;;results logistic regression;;design case-control study;;eight homologous landmarks;;thin-plate spline analysis,"morphometry of paranasal sinus anatomy in chronic rhinosinusitis: a pilot study.;;objectives to test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between anatomical variations around the ostiomeatal complex and a predisposition to chronic rhinosinusitis and to define such variations with increased precision.;;design case-control study of anatomical variations in diseased and normal sinuses.;;eight homologous landmarks defining the ostiomeatal complex were located on coronal computed tomographic scans, and their x and y coordinates were digitized using image analysis.;;subjects ten patients with unilateral sinus disease and 10 subjects without sinus disease (scanned for facial pain) who were selected retrospectively by case-note analysis.;;results logistic regression showed that the only significant spatial change predictive of a person with rhinosinusitis was the vertical position of the middle turbinate (p=.04), although this was not confirmed by wilcoxon testing (p>.10).;;when examined by sinus, however, the horizontal position of the uncinate process was more laterally placed in persons with rhinosinusitis (p=.01), confirmed on wilcoxon testing (p=.04), but there was no significant difference when compared with sinuses in persons without rhinosinusitis.;;conclusions our findings suggest that there are no anatomical differences within the ostiomeatal complex between patients with and without rhinosinusitis.;;patients with rhinosinusitis, however, are more likely to develop it in the side with a more laterally positioned uncinate process.;;further studies, with more patients and more advanced techniques, including thin-plate spline analysis, are indicated.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1998;124:656-658-->",significant difference;;indicated.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;sinus disease;;findings;;y coordinates;;unilateral sinus disease;;anatomical differences;;results logistic regression;;such variations;;more advanced techniques;;vertical position;;more patients;;anatomical variations;;sinus;;pilot study;;middle turbinate;;design case-control study;;uncinate process;;objectives;;patients;;eight homologous landmarks;;wilcoxon testing;;subjects;;test;;horizontal position;;morphometry;;only significant spatial change;;chronic rhinosinusitis;;relationship;;sinuses;;precision;;ostiomeatal complex;;persons;;normal sinuses;;case-note analysis;;null hypothesis;;predisposition;;paranasal sinus anatomy;;conclusions;;image analysis;;person;;tomographic scans;;thin-plate spline analysis;;rhinosinusitis;;facial pain;;side

"malignant infantile osteopetrosis: otolaryngological complications and management. objectives to inform otolaryngologists about upper airway obstruction requiring tracheotomy and other otolaryngological manifestations of malignant infantile osteopetrosis (miop) and to discuss pathophysiological features, management, and new treatment strategies in miop. design ongoing case series combined with a retrospective chart review. setting international tertiary pediatric hospital. interventions patients with miop were initially referred for treatment and routine follow-up. tracheotomy was performed to manage obstructive sleep apnea. audiograms were also performed at regular intervals. results the records of 9 patients were examined. the otolaryngological findings of hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea (sometimes requiring tracheotomy), otitis media, and chronic osteomyelitis with facial fistulas were identified. conclusions osteopetrosis is a rare condition caused by a failure of the osteoclast to resorb bone. this results in thickened dense, deformed, and easily fractured bone. as a result, growth failure, anemia, hypoplastic dentition, chronic infections, facial fistulas, blindness, hearing loss, nasal congestion, and upper airway obstruction may occur. the management of otolaryngological problems in a child with osteopetrosis is an important component in comprehensive care. to our knowledge, this study represents the largest case series of miop in the otolaryngology literature.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:689-694-->",miop;;upper airway obstruction;;malignant infantile osteopetrosis;;obstructive sleep apnea;;osteopetrosis;;facial fistulas;;hearing loss;;tracheotomy and other otolaryngological manifestations;;otolaryngological complications and management;;treatment and routine follow-up;;design ongoing case series;;international tertiary pediatric hospital;;new treatment strategies;;retrospective chart review;;largest case series;;tracheotomy;;pathophysiological features;;otolaryngological complications,"malignant infantile osteopetrosis: otolaryngological complications and management.;;objectives to inform otolaryngologists about upper airway obstruction requiring tracheotomy and other otolaryngological manifestations of malignant infantile osteopetrosis (miop) and to discuss pathophysiological features, management, and new treatment strategies in miop.;;design ongoing case series combined with a retrospective chart review.;;setting international tertiary pediatric hospital.;;interventions patients with miop were initially referred for treatment and routine follow-up.;;tracheotomy was performed to manage obstructive sleep apnea.;;audiograms were also performed at regular intervals.;;results the records of 9 patients were examined.;;the otolaryngological findings of hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea (sometimes requiring tracheotomy), otitis media, and chronic osteomyelitis with facial fistulas were identified.;;conclusions osteopetrosis is a rare condition caused by a failure of the osteoclast to resorb bone.;;this results in thickened dense, deformed, and easily fractured bone.;;as a result, growth failure, anemia, hypoplastic dentition, chronic infections, facial fistulas, blindness, hearing loss, nasal congestion, and upper airway obstruction may occur.;;the management of otolaryngological problems in a child with osteopetrosis is an important component in comprehensive care.;;to our knowledge, this study represents the largest case series of miop in the otolaryngology literature.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1998;124:689-694-->",pathophysiological features;;manage;;results;;upper airway obstruction;;design;;result;;malignant;;blindness;;otolaryngologists;;otolaryngology literature.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;routine follow-up;;management;;dense;;knowledge;;hearing loss;;media;;objectives;;retrospective chart review;;other otolaryngological manifestations;;treatment;;largest case series;;hypoplastic dentition;;failure;;new treatment strategies;;malignant infantile osteopetrosis;;chronic infections;;obstructive sleep apnea;;sleep apnea;;case series;;records;;interventions patients;;chronic osteomyelitis;;rare condition;;miop;;comprehensive care;;anemia;;tracheotomy;;important component;;child;;otolaryngological complications;;facial fistulas;;regular intervals;;osteopetrosis;;conclusions;;audiograms;;otolaryngological findings;;patients;;study;;nasal congestion;;international tertiary pediatric hospital;;growth failure;;bone;;otolaryngological problems
"posterior cricoidotomy lumen augmentation for treatment of subglottic stenosis in children. objectives to determine the results of posterior cricoidotomy lumen augmentation in the treatment of moderate and severe subglottic stenosis in children, and to assess the effect of this surgery on the growth of the larynx in young children. design a 17-year retrospective study. patients and methods thirteen children with moderate and severe subglottic stenosis who underwent posterior cricoidotomy lumen augmentation from 1980 to 1996. eight children (62%) were male and 5 (38%) were female. the average age was 4.7 years (age range, 8 months to 15 years). six (46%) of the 13 children were younger than 3 years. nine children (69%) had acquired subglottic stenosis, 3 of whom had a combined subglottic每posterior glottic stenosis, and 4 (31%) had congenital subglottic stenosis. all the children already had a tracheotomy tube placed and had undergone treatment at our clinic or at other institutions. the surgical procedure we used included a cricoid lamina split with grafting (2 children with costal cartilage graft and 11 with buccal mucosal graft) and stenting. results twelve (92%) of the 13 children underwent decannulation, and 1 (8%) is still undergoing treatment: decannulation is expected to be carried out in the near future. of the 12 children who underwent decannulation, 9 demonstrated good postoperative voice quality and 3, who had combined subglottic每posterior glottic stenosis, developed impaired voice function. following stent removal, all children experienced some degree of difficulty in swallowing saliva and liquids, which was soon overcome. no evidence of surgery-induced laryngeal growth impairment in younger children was observed. conclusions the posterior cricoidotomy lumen augmentation is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of moderate and severe subglottic stenosis in children of any age. this study lends further support to the assertion that external surgery does not affect the growth of the larynx in younger children.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:660-664-->",subglottic stenosis;;posterior cricoidotomy lumen

"sutureless cartilage graft laryngotracheal reconstruction using fibrin sealant. objective to determine whether fibrin sealant can replace suture as a means of holding a cartilage graft securely in the trachea. design randomized blinded control study comparing the use of fibrin sealant vs sutures in laryngotracheal reconstruction in ferrets. we compared results at 7 and 30 days. subjects forty ferrets randomized into 2 groups of 20: fibrin sealant and sutures. within each group, half were studied at 7 days and the rest at 30 days. no ferrets were withdrawn from study because of adverse effects of the intervention. intervention a carved costal cartilage graft was placed in the anterior cricoid split incision, and was secured with either fibrin sealant or sutures. all animals were extubated after recovery from anesthesia. specimens were examined grossly and histologically. results all animals survived until humanely killed. the pathologist, unaware of the groupings, measured lumen expansion in millimeters, cartilage graft migration, mucosal in-growth, degree of inflammation, graft integration, and graft viability. the fibrin sealant group had statistically significant (p<.05) better results in mucosal in-growth. in no categories was the suture group better than the fibrin sealant group. in comparing 7-day with 30-day results, the 30-day group had significantly better results in inflammation and graft viability. conclusions fibrin sealant can be used in place of sutures with improvement in mucosal growth in costal cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction in the experimental animal model. use of fibrin sealant (instead of sutures) may result in less surgical trauma and edema, less surgical time, and faster recovery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:665-670-->",fibrin sealant;;cartilage graft;;laryngotracheal reconstruction;;fibrin sealant group;;better results;;graft viability;;mucosal in-growth;;ferrets;;sutures;;sutureless cartilage graft laryngotracheal reconstruction;;less surgical trauma and edema;;anterior cricoid split incision;;inflammation and graft viability;;fibrin sealant or sutures;;costal cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction;;less surgical trauma;;costal cartilage graft,"sutureless cartilage graft laryngotracheal reconstruction using fibrin sealant.;;objective to determine whether fibrin sealant can replace suture as a means of holding a cartilage graft securely in the trachea.;;design randomized blinded control study comparing the use of fibrin sealant vs sutures in laryngotracheal reconstruction in ferrets.;;we compared results at 7 and 30 days.;;subjects forty ferrets randomized into 2 groups of 20: fibrin sealant and sutures.;;within each group, half were studied at 7 days and the rest at 30 days.;;no ferrets were withdrawn from study because of adverse effects of the intervention.;;intervention a carved costal cartilage graft was placed in the anterior cricoid split incision, and was secured with either fibrin sealant or sutures.;;all animals were extubated after recovery from anesthesia.;;specimens were examined grossly and histologically.;;results all animals survived until humanely killed.;;the pathologist, unaware of the groupings, measured lumen expansion in millimeters, cartilage graft migration, mucosal in-growth, degree of inflammation, graft integration, and graft viability.;;the fibrin sealant group had statistically significant (p<.05) better results in mucosal in-growth.;;in no categories was the suture group better than the fibrin sealant group.;;in comparing 7-day with 30-day results, the 30-day group had significantly better results in inflammation and graft viability.;;conclusions fibrin sealant can be used in place of sutures with improvement in mucosal growth in costal cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction in the experimental animal model.;;use of fibrin sealant (instead of sutures) may result in less surgical trauma and edema, less surgical time, and faster recovery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg.;;1998;124:665-670-->",anterior;;less surgical trauma;;edema;;ferrets;;trachea;;results;;rest;;better results;;faster recovery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg;;design;;control study;;laryngotracheal reconstruction;;anesthesia;;intervention;;fibrin sealant group;;use;;cartilage graft;;group;;fibrin sealant vs sutures;;graft viability;;conclusions;;improvement;;split incision;;comparing;;mucosal in-growth;;subjects;;inflammation;;objective;;place;;groupings;;specimens;;fibrin sealant;;suture group;;degree;;means;;cartilage graft migration;;costal cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction;;sutureless cartilage graft laryngotracheal reconstruction;;sutures;;30-day group;;pathologist;;groups;;adverse effects;;graft integration;;mucosal growth;;categories;;recovery;;animals;;experimental animal model;;study;;lumen expansion;;days;;30-day results;;carved costal cartilage graft;;suture;;millimeters;;surgical time;;significant ( p
"functional results of primary closure vs flaps in oropharyngeal reconstruction: a prospective study of speech and swallowing. background the preservation of speech and swallowing function is the primary goal when reconstructing soft tissue defects in the oral cavity or oropharynx. the type of reconstructive procedure used should be based on outcome data examining speech and swallowing function; yet, there is a paucity of such information. objectives to present the results of a multi-institutional prospective study of speech and swallowing function before and after soft tissue reconstruction of the oral cavity and oropharynx, and to compare 3 methods of reconstruction with respect to speech and swallowing function: primary closure, distal myocutaneous flap, and microvascular free flap. design prospective case-comparison study. setting four leading head and neck cancer institutions. patients the patients were selected from a database of 284 patients treated at the different institutions. the patients were matched for the location of the oral cavity or oropharyngeal defect and the percentage of oral tongue and tongue base resection. those patients who had previous speech and swallowing deficits and patients in whom postoperative fistulas or wound infections developed were excluded from the study. methods the patients underwent speech and swallowing evaluation preoperatively and 3 months after healing. this evaluation included videofluoroscopic studies of swallowing and tests of speech intelligibility and sentence articulation. videofluoroscopy provided measures of swallowing efficiency and bolus movement. liquid and paste consistencies were used in evaluating swallowing function. main outcome measure the functional results of the reconstruction. results patients who had primary closure were more efficient at swallowing liquids, had less pharyngeal residue, a longer oral transit time with paste, and higher conversational intelligibility than patients who underwent reconstruction with a distal flap. compared with patients who underwent reconstruction with a free flap, those who had primary closure had more efficient swallowing of liquids, less pharyngeal residue, and shorter pharyngeal delay times with paste. no difference in the speech and swallowing function existed between patients treated with distal myocutaneous flaps and those treated with microvascular free flaps. conclusion contrary to the current theory of oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction, we found that the use of primary closure resulted in equal or better function than the use of flap reconstruction in patients with a comparable locus of resection and percentage of oral tongue and tongue base resection.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:625-630-->",swallowing function;;primary closure;;oral cavity;;free flap;;microvascular free flap;;distal myocutaneous flap;;less pharyngeal residue;;functional results;;oropharyngeal reconstruction;;oral tongue;;paste;;oral cavity or oropharyngeal defect;;postoperative fistulas or wound infections;;primary closure vs flaps,"functional results of primary closure vs flaps in oropharyngeal reconstruction: a prospective study of speech and swallowing.;;background the preservation of speech and swallowing function is the primary goal when reconstructing soft tissue defects in the oral cavity or oropharynx.;;the type of reconstructive procedure used should be based on outcome data examining speech and swallowing function;
