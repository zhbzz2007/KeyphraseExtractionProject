estrogen prevention of recurrent epistaxis. both oral and vaginal mucosae become atrophic in estrogen-deficient women, with these changes responding well to either local or systemic estrogen therapy.1,2 the gums of estrogen-deficient women bleed more easily than those of otherwise similar women who are not estrogen deficient.3 the skin of postmenopausal women becomes atrophic due to loss of its collagen, this alteration returning to normal within a few months of estrogen supplementation.4,5 the influence of estrogen deficiency on the nasal mucosa, however, has apparently not been investigated.in my practice as a general internist, women receiving supplemental estrogen have seemed less likely to have epistaxis, and most postmenopausal women with frequent anterior epistaxis have demonstrated prominent atrophy of their nasal mucosa over kesselback's plexus, the usual site of their bleeding. seven of these women were advised to apply 0.5 cm of estrogen vaginal cream twice daily, by fingertip, to this area and then

terminal duct carcinoma: recognition of a low-grade salivary adenocarcinoma. we describe six cases of terminal duct carcinoma of the minor salivary glands. all were localized to the oral cavity, without regional nodal or distant metastases. histologically, five were originally mistaken for adenoid cystic carcinoma; one was interpreted as monomorphic adenoma with areas of adenoid cystic carcinoma. treatment consisted of wide resection with or without radiation therapy, with no incidence of recurrence or metastasis. the characteristics of this recently described pathologic entity are reviewed. the less aggressive behavior of this tumor compared with adenoid cystic carcinoma should call for less radical therapy, with a favorable prognosis in most cases. recognition of this tumor as a distinct clinical and pathologic entity is therefore important.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:1010-1015)

clinical study of alar anatomy and surgery of the alar base. objectives: to analyze and quantify specific aspects of alar base anatomy and to identify anatomic configurations that may be correlated with specific surgical manipulations. design: analysis in a population of patients presenting for aesthetic nasal surgery. setting: facial plastic surgery practice. patients: the photographic slides of 120 white patients who presented for consultation were reviewed. interventions: on the base view of photographic slides, observations were made on the width of the alar base, recurvature of the alar base, thickness of the alar lobule, thickness of the alar wall, and flare of the alar wall. on the lateral view, observations were made on the vertical insertion of the ala on the face (cephalic, normal, or caudal), contour of alar rim in profile (gentle s-shape or straight), size of alar lobule (small, normal, or large), and alar-columellar relationship, with special attention to the presence of alar hooding. main outcome measures: a spreadsheet program was used to analyze the incidence of each configuration and any association between various features of the alar base. results: anatomic diversity exists that requires a careful individual analysis for each patient. a planned surgical intervention must fit the patient's unique anatomy. distinctive configurations of recurvature, vertical insertion, and other aspects of the alar base were observed, with special implications for the surgeon's approach. conclusions: anatomic diversity requires a thorough preoperative examination followed by selection of an approach that addresses the specific anatomic findings. the choice of the best alar reduction and sculpture technique ultimately relies on a precise analysis of the anatomic configuration of the patient's alar base.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:789-795

the anterior extension face-lift. objective: to describe a face-lift technique with emphasis on extension of the temporal incision into the lateral orbital area. this modification serves several beneficial ends but must be used only in carefully selected patients. gathering of excess skin in the lateral orbital area is prevented, eliminating the typical disparity between relatively tight lower and middle facial skin and flaccid upper facial skin, which is commonly seen after rhytidectomy. the anterior extension also helps to support the lower eyelid, which is helpful when lid laxity exists or when concomitant blepharoplasty is performed. setting: a private cosmetic surgery center. participants: thirty-five patients undergoing rhytidectomy (15 primary and 20 revision procedures). outcome measure: patient satisfaction at 3 months after surgery. results: thirty-four (97%) of 35 patients were pleased with their results. conclusions: the anterior extension face-lift can provide excellent results in carefully selected patients. we have found this procedure to be especially helpful in patients undergoing revision surgery and in older patients with facial skin laxity.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:613-616)

treatment of ameloblastoma of the jaws. objective: to evaluate treatment of ameloblastoma of the jaws and suggest a more aggressive approach for well-defined cases. setting: referral center. patients: forty-one patients were treated for ameloblastoma of the jaws. results: seventeen patients had a local recurrence; 14 had initial curettage and three had initial resection. seven patients had two or more recurrences. eight patients underwent radiotherapy; two died of progressive disease. conclusions: ameloblastoma has a high rate of local recurrence if not adequately removed. segmental resection for the mandible and partial maxillectomy for the maxilla should be the primary treatment; marginal resection is appropriate only for small primary tumors. for multiple recurrences, radiotherapy is effective, and surgery and radiotherapy (50 gy postoperatively) should be used in selected cases.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:994-996)

the development of the rhinosinusitis disability index. assessment of patient perception of disability and outcomes from treatment has become an integral part of medical care. general quality-of-life measurement tools have led to the development of disease-specific quality instruments. conventional methods for evaluating nasal-sinus disease are inadequate to assess the impact of these disorders on everyday life. therefore, using methods that are well established and validated for creating instruments, the rhinosinusitis disability index was created to evaluate the self-perceived impact of disease-specific head and neck disorders. the development of the preliminary and final versions (30 items) of the rhinosinusitis disability index is described. content-related validity using cronbach's ¦Á measurement and construct-related validity were accomplished. a comparison of the responses between patients with and without documented nasal or sinus disease was used to verify that the rhinosinusitis disability index is a valid measuring instrument for patients with sinus disease, and test-retest validity reveals reliability over time.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1175-1179

is surgery necessary in stage iii and stage iv cancer of the head and neck that responds to induction chemotherapy?. objective: to study the influence of surgery in patients who achieve a response to induction chemotherapy. design: nonrandomized retrospective study. setting: comprehensive cancer center. patients: the records of all patients with stage iii and stage iv squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx were reviewed at the queensland radium institute, south brisbane, australia, in the years 1970 through 1990. interventions: there were 314 patients where induction chemotherapy was used as part of a curative treatment. complete response occurred in 20 patients, partial response in 110 patients, nonresponse in 162 patients, and unknown response in 22 patients. to assess the impact of surgery, the responders were divided into two treatment groups: one group (n=57) received chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy (c/s/xrt), and a second group (n=73) received chemotherapy and radiotherapy (c/xrt). main outcome measures: five-year survival, local failure, nodal failure, and distant failure. results: the 5-year actuarial survival for the chemotherapy responders and nonresponders was 58% and 43%, respectively (p<.05). when analyzed by treatment group, those receiving c/s/xrt had a 65% 5-year survival (95% confidence intervals [cis], 53 to 78) and those receiving c/xrt had a 56% 5-year survival (95% ci, 44 to 70). however, when the complete responders were assessed, those receiving c/s/xrt had a 90% 5-year survival (95% ci, 72 to 99) vs a 51% survival (95% ci, 18 to 89) for those treated with c/xrt. for the partial responders, the survival for the groups c/s/xrt and c/xrt were 59% (95% ci, 45 to 79) and 53% (95% ci, 41 to 67), respectively. chemotherapy responders were less likely to fail locally if they were treated with c/s/xrt than with c/xrt (21% vs 43%, p<.01). conclusion: the results suggest that surgery still has a role to play in patients who achieve a response with chemotherapy, even when the response is complete.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:467-471)

generation of therapeutic t cells from draining lymph nodes in a murine model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. objectives: to study immunotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using at-84, a spontaneously arising murine tumor. we examined the draining lymph nodes (dlns) for generation of potential therapeutic lymphocytes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. design: experimental randomized control trial. intervention: therapeutic t cells from dlns were generated by the sequential activation of the in vivoprimed dln cells with 2c11, an anti-cd3 antibody, and interleukin-2 (il-2). immunotherapy of mice bearing lung metastases was carried out in various experiments with low-dose systemic il-2 and activated dln cells. using a 4-hour radioactive chromium cr 51 release assay, in vitro cytotoxicity of these cells also was examined. results: mice immunized with this tumor failed to reject the growth of a subsequent challenge with the tumor. immunotherapy with low-dose systemic il-2 resulted in a mean reduction of 79% in the number of lung metastases. adoptive immunotherapy with activated dln cells was effective in all experiments, with a mean reduction of 59% in the number of metastases in immunodeficient mice. however, dln cells were not directly cytotoxic to the tumor cells in in vitro assays, unlike control lymphokine-activated killer cells. conclusions: at-84 is a nonimmunogenic tumor similar to many human malignant neoplasms, making this a suitable model for immunotherapy. low-dose systemic il-2 was effective in reduction of established metastasis in this model. activated dln cells show reproducible in vivo therapeutic efficacy despite lack of in vitro cytotoxicity. use of dln cells as sources of therapeutic t cells in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma deserves exploration because they are readily obtainable and because conventional treatment is of limited benefit.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:25-30

gamma probe¨Cdirected biopsy of the sentinel node in oral squamous cell carcinoma. objective management of the n0 neck in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is an important issue for the head and neck surgeon. experience with radionuclide-labeled colloid injection to identify a sentinel node in malignant melanoma suggests a high level of accuracy for this approach to identify microscopic metastasis when present. we set out to explore the feasibility of using the handheld gamma probe to identify radiolabeled sentinel nodes in oral squamous cell carcinoma. patient population five individuals with n0 necks and accessible oral or oropharyngeal primary sites from a major tertiary referral center. methods radiolabel with unfiltered technetium tc 99m sulfur colloid was injected in quadrants around the primary site followed by immediate dynamic lymphoscintigraphy. open biopsy of the sentinel node was accomplished within 2 hours of injection after extirpation of the primary site. regional or complete neck dissection was performed after sentinel node biopsy. results sentinel node biopsy accurately identified one or several nodes in 2 cases, including nodes containing metastatic cancer in 1. in the other 3 cases, the radiolabel failed to identify the sentinel node despite the presence of metastatic disease in the nodes at final pathologic study in 2. conclusions detection and biopsy of the sentinel node are feasible for selected patients with oral head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with n0 necks. there is a potential savings of time, cost, and morbidity with this approach. however, several substantial problems were encountered with the technique in this limited series of patients. establishing the reliability of lymphoscintigraphy in this setting would require testing in a much larger patient cohort. our experience suggests that such an investment may not be warranted.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:455-459-->

ototoxicity of topical ticarcillin and clavulanic acid in the chinchilla. background: currently available topical otic preparations contain a variety of antibiotics and other ingredients that are potentially damaging to the middle and inner ear. there is therefore a need to identify agents that are safe as well as effective for topical otologic use. in pursuit of that goal, we used an animal model to evaluate the ototoxic potential of the broad-spectrum, penicillin derivative ticarcillin¡ªboth alone and combined with clavulanic acid (a ¦Â-lactamase inhibitor). methods: twenty chinchillas served as subjects. ten of the animals were given a single middle ear application of ticarcillin; the remaining 10 animals received ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium (timentin). five animals from each of the two groups were killed after 1 week to assess short-term effects and the other five animals in each group were kept for 4 weeks before their temporal bones were removed for histologic study. results: significant toxic effects, involving both the middle and inner ear, were observed in all experimental groups. alterations of the middle ear at 1 week included inflammation, hemorrhage, and effusions. middle ear cholesteatomas were observed at 4 weeks. inner ear changes seen at i and 4 weeks included hair cell loss, supporting cell degeneration, and strial damage. conclusion: the study results indicate that ticarcillin should not be considered for further evaluation as a possible antibiotic for use in ototopical preparations.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:39-43)

effect of fluticasone in severe polyposis. objectives to investigate the effect of intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of polyps in patients with severe polyposis listed for surgical treatment and to determine the treatment effect on the progression of the disease. design a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12-week study at a single center. setting a tertiary referral center in london, england. patients thirty-four patients with severe polyposis listed for endoscopic surgical treatment. intervention by random allocation, fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (fpans), 200 ¦Ìg twice a day; beclomethasone dipropionate aqueous nasal spray, 200 ¦Ìg twice a day; or placebo nasal spray twice a day was administered. patients received 2 actuations to each nostril in the morning and in the evening. main outcome measures efficacy end points were the need for polypectomy at the end of treatment, the results of acoustic rhinometry, the polyp score, the peak nasal inspiratory flow rate, and an assessment of symptoms. results the polyp score was significantly decreased in the fpans-treated group (p¡Ü.01). the nasal cavity volume was significantly increased in both the fpans-treated group and the group receiving beclomethasone compared with placebo (p¡Ü.01) at the end of treatment. the percentage change in the mean morning peak nasal inspiratory flow rate was greater in the fpans-treated group, with a significant effect observed at week 2 (p=.01). nasal blockage was significantly decreased in both active groups compared with the group receiving placebo. no significant difference was observed between the treatment groups in the number of patients requiring polypectomy. conclusions fluticasone and beclomethasone aqueous nasal sprays are effective in treating the symptoms of severe nasal polyps. there was some evidence that the group treated with fpans responded more quickly to intervention and that the magnitude of the response was greater than in the group receiving beclomethasone.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:513-518-->

results of esophageal biopsies performed during triple endoscopy in the pediatric patient. background endoscopic examination (direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy) is the method of choice for diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of unknown cause in children. however, gastroesophageal reflux is being recognized increasingly often as a cause of pediatric respiratory symptoms and is difficult to diagnose on the basis of findings from direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. in cases in which gastroesophageal reflux was included in the differential diagnosis, we additionally performed esophagoscopy with esophageal mucosal biopsies. objectives to determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of routinely performing esophageal biopsies during triple endoscopy in children. methods twenty-four children ranging in age from 2 weeks to 10 years were referred for airway evaluation. under general anesthesia, children underwent direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy with mucosal biopsy. results esophageal mucosa biopsy specimens were quickly and safely obtained during endoscopic evaluation. there were no complications. reflux esophagitis was present in 54% of biopsy specimens, as suggested by basal cell hyperplasia, papillary elongation, and/or inflammatory cell infiltrates. conclusion gastroesophageal reflux is often difficult to diagnose in the pediatric population. when direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy is performed during examination of the child with airway symptoms, the addition of esophagoscopy with mucosal biopsies will safely and quickly provide data regarding the potential contribution of gastroesophageal reflux.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:545-549-->

micropathologic changes of pars tensa in children with otitis media with effusion. clinical studies have supported a relationship between otitis media with effusion in children and chronic otitis media in adults. although clinical studies are numerous, relatively little is known about the histopathologic changes of the tympanic membrane in otitis media with effusion. tympanic membranes were taken from the intermediate zone of the anteroinferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane during surgery for placement of tympanostomy tubes in 30 children (age range, 4 to 10 years) who did not show any improvement after 3 months of conservative treatment for otitis media with effusion. control specimens were taken from normal temporal bones at autopsy. all specimens were observed with light and electron microscopy. histologic degeneration of the tympanic membrane of patients with otitis media with effusion occurred most often in the lamina propria and the submucosal layer. there was an increase in the thickness of the tympanic membrane as a result of edema and fibrosis of the submucosal layer. a decrease in the thickness of the outer and inner fibrous layers occurred in the lamina propria. the histopathologic changes observed in the lamina propria may result in a change in the elastic properties of the tympanic membrane.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:815-819)

progressive hearing loss after transverse temporal bone fracture. transverse fractures often violate the otic capsule and commonly, although not invariably, result in immediate and profound sensorineural hearing loss. the pathogenic mechanisms producing sensorineural hearing loss include direct trauma to the cochlear nerve, disruption of the membranous labyrinth, vascular compromise or hemorrhage into the inner ear, perilymphatic fistula, and endolymphatic hydrops. the last two mechanisms account for the occasional patient who develops progressive sensorineural hearing loss after the initial insult. on early posttraumatic evaluation three patients were discovered to have transverse fractures and residual auditory function. deterioration of hearing led to middle-ear exploration with closure of perilymphatic fistulas. hearing was preserved in two patients. diagnosis of posttraumatic perilymphatic fistulas requires early audiometric assessment, high-resolution computed tomographic scanning of the temporal bones to detect fracture of the otic capsule and pneumolabyrinth, and a high index of clinical suspicion.

hearing aids: ii. implantable hearing aids. technological advances and functional and cosmetic improvements in conventional hearing aids notwithstanding, there are still individuals for whom alternative amplification schemes are desirable. patients generally fitted with bone-conduction hearing aids, eg, those with irreparable aural atresia, unremitting otorrhea, earmold allergy, or conductive losses not amenable to surgery, have difficulty with the pressure, poor fidelity, and unattractive appearance of these devices. patients capable of wearing conventional air-conduction hearing aids contend with sound distortion, feedback, canal occlusion, tight earmolds, and poor cosmetic appearance.1 a number of implantable hearing devices are in varying stages of development in an effort to overcome some of the limitations associated with conventional hearing aids.

combined modality treatment of advanced head and neck cancer. the recent article on the value of surgery after induction chemotherapy in advanced head and neck cancer is a valuable contribution to the medical literature.1 we agree with many of the comments and conclusions of the study about the need for surgery if possible.however, from a scientific and radiation oncology perspective, there are some significant concerns in the article. from a patient base of 317, only 130 responders are analyzed. the article is a nonrandomized retrospective study. the group receiving chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative radiation had a significantly higher proportion of oral cavity and hypopharynx tumors, while the group receiving chemotherapy and radiation was weighted with oropharyngeal lesions. similarly, 75% of patients in the chemotherapy-surgery-radiation arm received combination chemotherapy, while 70% in the chemotherapy-radiation arm received single-agent methotrexate.we agree with the advice not to modify local treatment (surgery or radiation) in chemotherapy responders. however, the radiation dose

septal perforation repair with acellular human dermal allograft. background connective tissue autografts are commonly used as interpositional grafts between septal flaps in the repair of septal perforations. the most common graft materials used include temporalis fascia and pericranium, both of which are accompanied by donor site morbidity, do not provide septal bulk, and are exceedingly thin and difficult to manage. objective to study the use of an acellular human dermal allograft (alloderm, lifecell corp, the woodlands, tex) as a connective tissue interpositional graft in septal perforation repair. setting private facial plastic surgery and reconstructive practice of 1 of the authors (r.w.h.k.), houston, tex, and the private and university practice of another author (h.f.), alexandria, egypt. patients twelve consecutive patients with septal perforation who received the acellular dermal allograft constituted this evaluation. the causes of the septal perforations were previous nasal surgery, previous nasal cautery, or cocaine use by the patient. design interposition grafting between mucoperichondrial flaps for septal perforation repair was accomplished with decellularized human dermal grafts. follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 14 months. main outcome measures the repair was considered successful when, on postoperative examination at 3 months, the right and left mucoperichondrial flaps were entirely healed. from the experience of 1 author (r.w.h.k.) with the repair of more than 75 septal perforations, no perforation that was healed at 3 months broke down at a later date, unless trauma or cocaine use occurred after the operation. an outcome was considered acceptable but nondesirable if a perforation was still present after the operation but the number and severity of the patient's symptoms were reduced and the perforation was considerably smaller than before the operation. results eleven of the 12 patients had successful outcomes with complete closure of their perforations. the 1 remaining patient had an acceptable result but incomplete closure; his initial perforation of 3 cm was reduced to 5 mm, making him asymptomatic after surgery. conclusion acellular human dermal grafts can be used as connective tissue interpositional grafts in the repair of septal perforations with success rates similar to the use of temporalis fascia, mastoid periosteum, or pericranium. one distinct advantage is the absence of donor-site morbidity. in addition, this graft material is thicker and easier to place and suture and may give more substance to the repaired septum.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:73-78-->

functional results of primary closure vs flaps in oropharyngeal reconstruction: a prospective study of speech and swallowing. background the preservation of speech and swallowing function is the primary goal when reconstructing soft tissue defects in the oral cavity or oropharynx. the type of reconstructive procedure used should be based on outcome data examining speech and swallowing function; yet, there is a paucity of such information. objectives to present the results of a multi-institutional prospective study of speech and swallowing function before and after soft tissue reconstruction of the oral cavity and oropharynx, and to compare 3 methods of reconstruction with respect to speech and swallowing function: primary closure, distal myocutaneous flap, and microvascular free flap. design prospective case-comparison study. setting four leading head and neck cancer institutions. patients the patients were selected from a database of 284 patients treated at the different institutions. the patients were matched for the location of the oral cavity or oropharyngeal defect and the percentage of oral tongue and tongue base resection. those patients who had previous speech and swallowing deficits and patients in whom postoperative fistulas or wound infections developed were excluded from the study. methods the patients underwent speech and swallowing evaluation preoperatively and 3 months after healing. this evaluation included videofluoroscopic studies of swallowing and tests of speech intelligibility and sentence articulation. videofluoroscopy provided measures of swallowing efficiency and bolus movement. liquid and paste consistencies were used in evaluating swallowing function. main outcome measure the functional results of the reconstruction. results patients who had primary closure were more efficient at swallowing liquids, had less pharyngeal residue, a longer oral transit time with paste, and higher conversational intelligibility than patients who underwent reconstruction with a distal flap. compared with patients who underwent reconstruction with a free flap, those who had primary closure had more efficient swallowing of liquids, less pharyngeal residue, and shorter pharyngeal delay times with paste. no difference in the speech and swallowing function existed between patients treated with distal myocutaneous flaps and those treated with microvascular free flaps. conclusion contrary to the current theory of oral and oropharyngeal reconstruction, we found that the use of primary closure resulted in equal or better function than the use of flap reconstruction in patients with a comparable locus of resection and percentage of oral tongue and tongue base resection.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:625-630-->

submucosal tumor extension in hypopharyngeal cancer. objectives: to study the incidence and extent of submucosal tumor extension in hypopharyngeal cancer and to evaluate the impact on the tumor recurrence and overall survival rates. method: fifty-seven resected specimens of hypopharyngeal cancer were studied in detail from january 1986 to december 1989 by use of the whole-organ, step¡ªserial sectioning technique. results: three types of submucosal tumor extension could be identified. type i extension was characterized by a tumor with a smooth round contour that extended submucosally. the mucosa was thereby elevated and was detectable on gross inspection at operation. in type ii extension, tongues and islands of tumor infiltrated within the submucosa, and these were not noticeable on gross examination. skip metastasis in the submucosa where the submucosal tumor was completely separated from the main tumor bulk was classified as type iii extension. thirty-three patients (58%) had submucosal tumor extension. the frequencies (and extents of submucosal tumor extension) in the superior, medial, lateral, and inferior directions were 16% (3-10 mm), 37% (2-37 mm), 26% (2-37 mm), and 28% (3-35 mm), respectively. two thirds of the submucosal extension was type i (22 of 33), and only 1 patient had a true skip lesion submucosally (type iii extension). type ii submucosal extension was found in one third of the patients (11 of 33). this occurred significantly more often in the patients who had received radiotherapy before surgery (82% 9/11]; p<.001; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-4.44). the presence of submucosal tumor extension had no effect on the tumor recurrence and overall survival rates. conclusions: the incidence of submucosal tumor extensions in hypopharyngeal cancer is high (58%), but most (67%) of them can be detected grossly at operation. the presence of submucosal tumor extension does not adversely affect the survival and tumor recurrence rates.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:959-965

in vitro growth suppression by adenoviral transduction of p21 and p16 in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a research model for combination gene therapy. objectives to determine the duration of expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 and p16 and the effect of these 2 genes both alone and in combination on the growth of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines in vitro. experimental methods and design cells were transduced via an adenoviral vector with p21 (ad5cmv-p21), p16 (ad5cmv-p16), or both. western blotting was performed to determine duration of expression of the protein products of the transduced p21 and p16 genes. in vitro growth assays and cell cycle analyses were performed on transduced cells. results transduced gene products were detected up to day 12 after infection. western blotting showed high levels of p21 and p16 in transduced cells. growth suppression was observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cell lines transduced with ad5cmv-p21, ad5cmv-p16, or both, but the combination of p21 and p16 did not achieve significantly greater growth suppression than that seen in cells transduced with ad5cmv-p16 alone. cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the percentage of cells arrested at g1 stage in the cells transduced with ad5cmv-p16 was similar to that in the cells transduced with both ad5cmv-p21 and ad5cmv-p16. no significant in vivo growth suppression was observed in tumor nodules treated with ad5cmv-p16. conclusions although p21 and p16 are believed to function as cell cycle regulators of cyclin-dependent kinases, we observed no additive or synergistic effect when using them in combination. the expression of transduced p21 and p16 gene products up to days 9 and 12, respectively, was consistent with the growth suppression and cell cycle arrest observed. this work provides information on the previously uncharacterized duration of p21 and p16 transgene product expression and also lends insight into the interaction of these 2 cell cycle regulators in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:88-92-->

effects of sinus surgery on speech. objective: to determine the effects of sinus surgery on the production and perception of speech. design: vocal recordings were performed before, 1 week after, and at least 1 month after sinus surgery. acoustic spectra were analyzed for nasal consonants/m/and/n/, nasalized vowels, and nonnasalized vowels. results for nasal consonants were compared with similar recordings obtained from a group of normal subjects with no history of sinus disease. perceptual analysis of nasalized vowels was conducted by trained phoneticians. setting: private practice at an academic medical center. subjects: five patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and 3 normal subjects. main outcome measures: the spectral characteristics and perceptual attributes of nasal sounds. results: significant differences in spectral properties were observed for the consonants and nasalized vowels recorded before and after surgery (p<.001). perceptual experiments for nasalized vowels demonstrated a postoperative decrease in nasality for the high vowel/i/, as in "beep," and an increase in nasality for the non-high vowel/?/, as in "bad." these perceived changes correlated well with acoustic measures of nasal peak amplitudes and the lowest resonance peak amplitude of the vocal tract. conclusions: sinus surgery results in measurable effects on the produced acoustic signal and the perceived nasality of a patient's speech. the identified acoustic correlates may be useful for preoperative counseling of patients concerning expected changes in speech quality following surgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:845-852

benign intratracheal thyroid: a possible cause for preoperative overstaging. we report a rare case of intratracheal thyroid ectopia in the setting of papillary thyroid carcinoma, resulting in the preoperative clinical impression of an aggressive, high-stage tumor. a 24-year-old opera singer presented with complaints of a gagging or choking sensation. the results of computed tomography revealed a mass in the left thyroid lobe with multiple small calcifications consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma as well as a soft tissue mass in the adjacent left tracheal lumen thought to be direct invasion by the thyroid tumor. a total thyroidectomy was performed including excision of half of the first and second tracheal cartilages and the lower portion of the hemicricoid cartilage. the final histological findings revealed that the intratracheal component was composed of benign thyroid tissue and strands of benign thyrocytes coursed through the first tracheal membrane. intratracheal thyroid ectopia is a rare symptomatic occurrence with a striking female predisposition. we have identified 23 cases of intratracheal thyroid ectopia from the literature. they occur most often at the level of the cricoid, usually posteriorly with a slight predisposition for the left side. continuity between the intratracheal component and the thyroid lobe may be seen. clinicians and pathologists must be aware of this entity to avoid mistaking it for evidence of thyroid invasion by a malignant neoplasm.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:1266-1269-->

mechanism of tracheoesophageal shunt phonation. objective: to elucidate the phonatory mechanism of tracheoesophageal shunt speech after total laryngectomy, we examined the dynamics and origin of neoglottis in tracheoesophageal shunt speakers. design: we conducted the videofluoroscopic, strobofiberscopic, and electromyographic studies of the pharyngoesophageal segment in tracheoesophageal shunt phonation. setting: academic referral medical center. patients: twenty-five tracheoesophageal shunt speakers were examined. results: videofluoroscopic and fiberscopic examinations showed two bulges in the pharyngeoesophageal segment. the upper bulge was revealed to be the sound source of tracheoesophageal shunt speech by the stroboscopic examination; anteroposterior and undulating regular movements were observed. electromyographic study elucidated the contribution of muscle contraction to the two bulges; the upper bulge is formed by the thyropharyngeal muscle, whereas the lower bulge corresponds to the cricopharyngeal muscle. conclusion: the neoglottis was considered to be formed by the stenotic portion due to thyropharyngeal muscle contraction and mucosal vibration due to expiratory airflow. this new understanding of the phonatory mechanism will be indispensable in the treatment of cases with failing shunt speech.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:648-652)

increased mutagen sensitivity in patients with head and neck cancer is less pronounced in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. background mutagen sensitivity tested with bleomycin sulfate can determine a susceptible phenotype, which is relevant only in organs and tissues that have direct contact with the external environment. patients with head and neck cancers have more mutagen sensitivity than control subjects without cancer, and the hypersensitive phenotype has a risk for the development of a second primary cancer. head and neck cancers, however, represent a heterogeneous group of neoplasm. the biological behavior of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) and other head and neck cancers differs. objective to evaluate the difference in mutagen sensitivity among patients without cancer, patients with npc, patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer (orc), and patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer (lhc). design peripheral blood was cultured at 37¡ãc, using 5% carbon dioxide, for 72 hours. after 67 hours of incubation, bleomycin in a concentration of 30 iu/l was added to induce chromatid breaks. the number of chromatid breaks per cell was scored in 50 metaphases of cultured lymphocytes and compared in the 4 groups. subjects patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the mucosa of the upper digestive tract, which included 3 groups: patients with npc, patients with orc, and those with lhc. control subjects were hospital inpatients with no tumor history. there were 35 patients in each group. results the mean (¡Àsd) number of breaks per cell in the control group and in the groups with npc, orc, and lhc were 0.80 (¡À0.32), 1.03 (¡À0.45), 1.30 (¡À0.44), and 1.35 (¡À0.46), respectively. all the cancer groups had significantly higher mean breaks per cell and a higher prevalence of hypersensitivity than the control group. patients with npc had a significantly lower mean number of breaks per cell than the group with orc or that with lhc. conclusions patients with npc had less mutagen sensitivity than those with orc or lhc. our results support the clinical and epidemiological findings of a difference between npc and other head and neck cancers. environmental factors might play a less pronounced role in the carcinogenesis of npc.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:578-581-->

vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in patients with acoustic neuromas. background to diagnose acoustic neuromas (ans), the auditory brainstem response test and the caloric test have been used in addition to magnetic resonance imaging. the auditory brainstem response and the caloric tests mainly reflect functions of the auditory pathway, ie, the cochlear nerve and the superior vestibular nerve, respectively. because the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (vemp) has been thought to originate in the inferior vestibular nerve, we hypothesized that the vemp could provide different information from the auditory brainstem response and the caloric test and that it could be helpful in diagnosing ans. in other words, we hypothesized that the vemp could provide information concerning inferior vestibular nerve involvement in patients with ans. objective to find out if the vemp could be useful in classifying ans according to the involved nerves. design we reviewed preoperative clinical tests, including vemps, in 21 patients (8 men, 13 women) with ans confirmed surgically and histopathologically, comparing them with vemps in 8 normal subjects (5 men, 3 women). results whereas the first positive-negative peak of the vemp, p13-n23, was ipsilaterally present on stimulation of the unaffected side in all patients with ans and both sides in all normal subjects, it was absent on the affected side in 15 patients (71%) and significantly decreased in amplitude in 2 patients (9%). thus, 17 (80%) of the 21 patients showed abnormal vemps. three patients had abnormal vemps although they had normal caloric responses. three patients had abnormal caloric responses although they had normal vemps. conclusion these results suggest that the vemp could be useful for the diagnosis of an, especially for classifying ans according to the involved nerves.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:509-512-->

versatility of the free anterolateral thigh flap for reconstruction of head and neck defects. objective: the anterolateral thigh flap has many advantages in head and neck reconstruction. however, it has not yet come into widespread use because of the anatomic variations of its perforators. herein, we describe a safe operative technique related to the patterns of the perforators and discuss its wide versatility. setting: a national cancer center hospital. patients: thirty-eight anterolateral thigh flaps were transferred. confirmation and dissection of the flap pedicle were simultaneously performed with tumor resection. the design and elevation of the flap were carried out immediately after the tumor resection was completed. results: from the study of the anatomic variations of the perforators, septocutaneous patterns were recognized in 10 cases (26.3%) and musculocutaneous patterns in 28 cases (73.7%). all flaps were easily and safely elevated with our techniques. thirty-six flaps survived. partial necrosis was noted owing to excessive thinning procedure in one patient and total necrosis was noted owing to venous thrombosis at the anastomosis part in another patient. conclusions: we found that the anterolateral thigh flap has numerous advantages. it is possible to perform the flap elevation and the tumor resection simultaneously. the flap is generally thin and is suitable for reconstruction of intraoral defects. combined flaps with neighboring tissues and other, distant flaps can be used. furthermore, since our technique minimizes the problems of confirmation and dissection of the perforators, we conclude that this flap can be successfully used to repair a variety of large defects of the head and neck.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1325-1331

the endoscopic approach to the pituitary gland. we present the use of the rigid sinus endoscope for the removal of two benign pituitary neoplasms. after a search of the relevant literature it appears that the use of the rigid endoscope has been confined to surgical procedures on the paranasal sinuses. with the addition of the techniques of endoscopic sinus surgery to this interface of otolaryngology and neurosurgery, we believe an alternative to transseptal or traditional transsinal procedures has been introduced.both patients who underwent pituitary gland resection for benign adenoma presented with visual complaints prompting discovery of the tumors. appropriate endocrinologic consultation was obtained before surgery. septoplasty was not required in either patient. the procedures were performed with the patients under general anesthesia with the use of topical and injectable anesthetic solutions as with other endoscopic procedures. the first patient developed a cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea on the third postoperative day that was repaired with endoscopic application of

problems with tracheoesophageal fistula voice restoration in totally laryngectomized patients: a review of 95 cases. objectives: tracheoesophageal fistula (tef) construction, performed during or after total laryngectomy, is used for voice and speech restoration but has been associated with mild to severe complications. our goal was to study the successes and complications in the application of this technique to restore voice function after laryngectomy in 95 consecutive patients. research design: retrospective cohort study with a mean follow-up time of 3.5 years. setting: five medical facilities in northern california: the veterans affairs medical centers in san francisco and martinez, the kaiser permanente medical center in oakland, and private practice offices in san francisco and pinole. patients: ninety-five patients (90 men and five women) who had undergone total laryngectomy with subsequent or primary tef construction. patients' ages ranged from 35 to 80 years. interventions: three- or two-layer closure was used, depending on whether tef construction was done as a secondary or a primary procedure. most patients underwent radiation therapy, and most used surface or intraoral electrolarynx devices before tef construction. insufflation tests were performed by clinicians, or self-insufflation tests were performed by the patient. patients' voices were recorded and analyzed. in many cases, respiratory and pulmonary function studies were performed before and after total laryngectomy or tef. blom-singer and groningen voice prostheses were used. main outcome measures: voice restoration was considered successful when the patient was able to communicate effectively via the tef. results: approximately 92% of patients who underwent tef construction and had voice prostheses placed were considered to be successfully rehabilitated. complications ranged from mild to severe and included problems with predictive values obtained during insufflation, fistula retention, tef angulation shifts, fungal colonization of the prosthesis, valve retention problems, difficulty with digital occlusion, pressure necrosis, postradiation necrosis, dysphagia, phonatory gagging, emesis, gastric distention, pouching, stenosis, infection, hypertrophy, shunt insufficiency, persistent spasm, myotomy, inadvertent fistula closure, and aspiration of the prosthesis. conclusions: acoustic measures indicate that speech produced with the tef compares better with normal laryngeal speech than does esophageal or electronic speech. thus, tef should remain the preferred procedure to rehabilitate patients undergoing total laryngectomy.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:840-845)

neuromuscular hamartomas of the head and neck. the neuromuscular hamartoma (also referred to as the neuromuscular choristoma or benign triton tumor) is a rare developmental lesion composed of mature elements of both striated muscle and nerve. to date, less than 20 cases have been reported in the english language literature. the majority of these have involved large nerves, such as the sciatic or brachial plexus, but cutaneous lesions have also been reported. we report 2 cases that involve the head and neck and that are among the few described in this location. the majority of cases have been described in infants and young children. however, 1 of our cases (and at least 1 previously reported case) occurred in an adult. while surgical excision has been the most widely used form of therapy, a few cases have been complicated by and/or associated with a second lesion, such as a fibromatosis or lymphangioma.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:212-216-->

time course of bell palsy. this study was designed to quantitatively characterize the time course of facial palsy and the relationship between electroneurography and the facial nerve grading percentage as a function of onset time. bilateral electroneurographic recordings during different stages in the course of the disease were repeated and compared with categorized videotaped facial movements using the house-brackmann facial nerve grading system in 32 patients with bell palsy. preliminary results of this study demonstrate a time gap between the percentage of electroneurographic response and the category of the facial nerve grading system during the same period of disease progress. a theoretical model of the time course and specific patterns regarding the recovery of facial function is established. the theoretical time course of facial palsy is divided into 3 stages: preclinical, clinical, and postclinical. based on the time course of electroneurographic and facial grading functions, the period between 10 and 14 days after onset was found to be most valuable for prediction of recovery. according to this theoretical model, a given time course pattern based on the results of serial electroneurographic recordings provides reliable prognostic information on recovery from bell palsy.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:967-972

growth inhibition of squamous cell carcinoma xenografts with the polyamine analogue be 4444. background: the capacity of radiation to cure advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is compromised by the proliferation of surviving tumor cells during the course of therapy (overall duration, often 7-9 weeks). antiproliferative agents that inhibit tumor proliferation, even in the absence of direct cytotoxicity, may be useful adjuncts for concurrent use with radiation. modulation of endogenous polyamine (pa) metabolism has the potential to inhibit cell growth. the pa analogue 1,19-bis(ethylamino)-5,10,15-triazanonadecane (be 4444) is a synthetic compound that demonstrates antiproliferative effects in human tumor cells. objective: to evaluate the pa analogue be 4444 for its inhibitory effect on the growth of human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. design: xenografts of human squamous cell carcinomas were grown in nude mice; then, be 4444 was injected intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg) on a twice-daily schedule for 8 days. tumor growth measurements were performed twice weekly for 8 weeks and compared with those of control mice that were injected with sterile saline solution on the same schedule. the pa levels in the tumor and normal tissue samples were assayed at the completion of treatment. results: tumor volume in the be 4444¨Ctreated mice was reduced by 62% compared with tumor volumes in control mice, and the tumor growth rate was reduced by 64%. this growth inhibition was maintained through completion of the experiment. levels of endogenous pas were not significantly different from control levels, suggesting that the mechanism of action for be 4444 is not simply pa biosynthesis inhibition. conclusions: the pa analogue be 4444 is an inhibitor of human squamous cell cancer growth. further studies are in progress to characterize the potential value of pa analogues as adjuncts to radiation therapy for rapidly proliferating squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:977-981

effects of global competition on health care administration in finland and the united states: what you can do to save your practice. global competition, a faltering finnish economy, and deep recession are forcing difficult decisions on the health care administrators of this nordic country known for its extensive social welfare safety net and socialized health care system. in the first part of this article the finnish health care system and its problems, as well as possible solutions, are presented. similarities to our own system are noted and discussed. in an interview, the director general for the minister of social affairs and health of finland, kimmo leppo, expressed concern about future funding sources in his country for the same levels of social welfare and health care programs that presently exist. the finns are considering managed competition among providers, increasing copayments, excess hospital beds, anticipated hospital closures in their country, block grants, and how to deal with rising physician unemployment. he was interested in the proposed us government health care plans, and especially the state of tennessee's tenncare plan, a state plan that closely resembled the failed clinton health care reform package. the second part of this article explores how global competition has brought the pressure of modern competitive economics into the us medical arena.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:241-250)

laryngeal manifestations of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an acquired blistering skin disease caused by autoantibodies to the dermoepidermal junction of the skin. patients present with tense bullae over areas of trauma, commonly the palms, soles, elbows, and knees. when the lesions heal, they leave a dense scar. in the head and neck, bullae in the buccal mucosa and the cervical esophagus cause strictures. to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita of the larynx. the patient had severe supraglottic stenosis that was caused by the trauma of a routine intubation. we describe the clinical and histologic characteristics of the disease and suggest managing the strictures with balloon dilation to minimize trauma and prevent further lesions and scarring.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:1042-1044)

delayed diagnosis and fate of congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma). objective: to analyze clinical presentation, modes of detection, growth pattern, operative findings, and results of surgery in children 3 years old or older who had extensive congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma). design: survey, case series. setting: two academically affiliated medical centers: a children's hospital and an eye, ear, and throat hospital, both located in major metropolitan cities. patients: twenty-five children selected according to specified criteria. intervention: tympanomastoid surgery, ie, canal wall up and canal wall down, some with ossicular reconstructive surgery. main outcome measure: audiologic assessment (speech reception threshold) and recurrence (recidivism) of cholesteatoma. results: incidence of recidivism, 52%. hearing maintained within the range of normal to mild hearing impairment postoperatively in 91 % of the patients for whom complete data are available. conclusions: congenital cholesteatoma may grow for years without causing signs or symptoms and, having grown without early detection, can extend to involve the epitympanum and mastoid antrum, cause ossicular erosion, and even extend to the middle cranial fossa. to adequately remove a congenital cholesteatoma that has gone undetected for many years, exposure of the anterior epitympanum is often necessary and removal of both the body of the incus and the head of the malleus often is required. since congenital cholesteatoma usually develops in a child with a well-pneumatized mastoid that would create a large mastoid bowl if exteriorized, the otologic surgeon is likely to hesitate in using the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique. alternatives to the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique, which can achieve reasonably good hearing results and avoid creation of a large mastoid bowl, include planned two-stage canal wall up surgery or canal preservation with primary reconstruction and close follow-up with otomicroscopy and serial computed tomographic scans.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:903-907)

laryngeal abductor reinnervation with a phrenic nerve transfer after a 9-month delay. background successful restoration of laryngeal abductor function, using the phrenic nerve, has been described in the cat model in the acute phase. however, in clinical practice there is usually a considerable delay between injury to the rln and presentation for treatment. delayed reinnervation therefore would be more suitable in clinical practice. objective to test the feasibility of delayed selective abductor reinnervation following transection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (rln). materials and methods in 12 cats, the right rln was severed. nine months later, the phrenic nerve was anastomosed to the distal rln stump with all its branches directed toward the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. for 10 weeks after the reconstruction, electromyography and videolaryngoscopy were performed weekly. finally, histological analysis of the rln was performed. results evaluation was possible in 11 cats. reinnervation of the right posterior cricoarytenoid muscle with the phrenic nerve occurred in 10 cats following nerve anastomosis, but results of videolaryngoscopy showed adequate to good abduction in only 4 cats. the main limiting factor was reduced mobility of the cricoarytenoid joint. evidence of spontaneous subclinical reinnervation after the delay was observed in 7 cats but apparently did not impede the surgical reinnervation. conclusions delayed selective laryngeal abductor reinnervation was feasible, but function recovery was less successful than if performed immediately. future investigations should concentrate on early determinants of spontaneous restoration of function to allow early selection of patients who are eligible for reinnervation surgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:393-398-->

use of a mechanical microvascular anastomotic device in head and neck free tissue transfer. background: the use of mechanical microvascular anastomotic systems for free tissue transfer has previously been reported. currently, a commercially available coupling device (3m healthcare, st paul, minn) is widely used for various microvascular free flaps. however, to our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature describing the efficacy of this particular device in regard to free tissue transfer in head and neck reconstruction. objective: to describe the surgical technique, limitations, and guidelines for application of this system for vascular anastomosis in head and neck free tissue transfer. design: the microvascular anastomotic device was used in 79 head and neck free flaps: radial forearm (n=28), rectus abdominis (n=27), fibula (n=12), lateral thigh (n=4), iliac crest (n=3), gracilis (n=2), jejunum (n=1), pectoral (n=1), and lateral arm (n=1). follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2.5 years. setting: two major teaching/referral medical centers. participants: seventy-six patients ranging in age from 19 to 86 years. intervention: a total of 105 anastomoses (17 arterial and 88 venous) were performed. outcome measures: anastomotic times and patency rates were evaluated. results: the anastomotic times ranged from 8 to 18 minutes for the arteries (average, 10 minutes) and from 4 to 16 minutes for the veins (average, 5 minutes). none of the flaps resulted in venous congestion due to thrombosis at the anastomosis. two arterial anastomoses resulted in thrombosis, one of which was detected intraoperatively and successfully salvaged with conventional suture anastomosis. conclusions: the patency rates with the microvascular anastomotic system appear to compare favorably with those of standard suture techniques. the major advantage is that the time of venous anastomosis is reduced, thereby decreasing the total ischemic time. an additional advantage is the ease with which anastomoses can be performed when the vessels are deep within a wound, where suture placement is difficult.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:529-532)

airway management of neonates with antenatally detected head and neck anomalies. five cases of prenatally detected neck masses that had a potential for airway obstruction at birth are described. the various options for management of the airway are discussed, including using maternal-fetal circulation until intubation, rigid bronchoscopy, tracheotomy, cyst aspiration, or extracorporeal membrane oxygen support. congenital abnormalities involving the fetal face or neck are extremely rare. with technical advances in ultrasonography, these masses were first noted on prenatal ultrasound in the late 1970s. before that period, they were detected at delivery. these masses are solid or cystic and may cause asphyxia because of airway obstruction at the time of delivery. the survivability of these neonates without immediate intervention at birth is 0% to 20%. if a neck mass is detected in the fetus by prenatal ultrasonography, then a strategic plan for these types of cases should be developed early in the prenatal period. the airway management plan should be tailored for each individual case. coordination and the expertise of an obstetrician, neonatologist, anesthesiologist, and pediatric otolaryngologist are needed to manage these complex situations.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:641-645

laryngeal tuberculosis: a cause of stridor in children. the number of tuberculosis (tb) cases reported in the united states has been on the decline for the last three decades. this trend has been dramatically reversed in the past few years, largely owing to the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. laryngeal tb, while well recognized in the adult population, is a rare disease in children. only six cases have been described in the world literature since 1960. we describe three children with laryngeal tb who presented with stridor. one child required an emergency tracheotomy for control of the airway. the pathogenesis of laryngeal tb in children is postulated to differ from that in adults. in children primary infection of the larynx occurs, while in adults, laryngeal infection is secondary to pulmonary disease. all patients had triple anti-tb chemotherapy for 1 year. laryngeal tb, although rare, may be seen more frequently in the near future and the diagnosis should always be considered.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:109-112)

adenotonsillectomy for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in children. objectives: to determine (1) the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (osa) in children with a suggestive history; (2) the effectiveness of surgery in treating osa in children; and (3) factors that may help the physician select patients who have physiologically significant osa and are likely to respond to surgery. design: prospective study. patients: sixty-nine children aged 1 to 14 years who were referred to the otolaryngologist for evaluation of suspected osa. interventions: thirty children with a respiratory disturbance index (rdi) greater than 5 underwent adenotonsillectomy. twenty-six of the 30 children had follow-up polysomnography. main outcome measures: polysomnography after surgery. results: thirty-five (51%) of 69 children had an rdi greater than 5 on polysomnography. twenty-six of the 30 children who underwent adenotonsillectomy for osa had follow-up polysomnography. all 26 children had a lower rdi after surgery, although four patients still had an rdi greater than 5. a preoperative rdi of 19.1 or less predicted a postoperative rdi of 5 or less. history and physical findings were not useful in predicting outcome. conclusions: all patients improved with adenotonsillectomy, but patients with the most severe rdi often had many respiratory events after surgery. history and physical examination alone are not sufficient to assess the severity of osa or the likelihood of an adequate response to surgical treatment.(arch otolarygol head neck surg. 1995;121:525-530)

communication after laryngectomy: an assessment of patient satisfaction. objectives: to determine the satisfaction of patients with their current method of alaryngeal communication. to focus primarily on the patients' perception of their own speech. design: a retrospective review of patients who underwent total laryngectomy for malignancy identified 4 groups of patients. a survey using a mailed questionnaire was used to compare groups. setting: tertiary care university hospital, university of texas medical branch at galveston. patients: forty-seven patients underwent total laryngectomy for cancer and survived. thirty-one of the 47 patients responded to the survey. patients were divided into 4 groups by their current method of communication: (1) tablet writers; (2) esophageal speech; (3) electrolarynx; and (4) tracheoesophageal speech. main outcome measures: satisfaction with communication, satisfaction with speech quality, ability to communicate over telephone, limitation of interaction with others, and satisfaction with quality of life. results: patients in group 4 were significantly more satisfied with their speech (p<.001), perceived their speech to be of better quality (p<.001), had improved ability to communicate over the telephone (p<.001), and had less limitation of their interactions with others (p<.004). patients in group 4 also rated their overall quality of life higher (p=.23). conclusion: although many studies in the past have demonstrated the objective superiority of tracheoesophageal speech compared with other methods of alaryngeal communication, most studies have focused on the intelligibility of speech judged by listeners. this study demonstrates that patients who use tracheoesophageal speech rate their own speech significantly higher than patients who use other methods and most likely have an overall superior quality of life.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:493-496

cardiac complication from use of cocaine and phenylephrine in nasal septoplasty. cocaine hydrochloride is widely used as a topical anesthetic for otolaryngologic surgery. cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, are well-documented side effects of illicit cocaine use. we describe a 23-year-old woman without coronary artery disease who had an acute non¡ªq-wave myocardial infarction and stunned myocardium after receiving topical phenylephrine hydrochloride and cocaine anesthesia for elective nasal septoplasty. these cases are rare; however, we hope to heighten the awareness of the potential lethal complications of using cocaine, phenylephrine, or the combination of both as topical anesthetics in otolaryngologic practice.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:681-684)

late recurrences of laryngeal papillomatosis. laryngeal papillomotasis recurred in 2 patients after 44 and 47 years of remission. the recurrence of papillomatosis after such lengthy periods of remission underscores the fact that, while surgical treatment of laryngeal papillomatosis may maintain the airway and voice, and in some cases control clinically overt disease, it does not address the subclinical mucosal human papillomavirus infection that may lead to recurrence many years after surgery. arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:942-944

risk factors for ototoxicity due to cisplatin. objective: to determine whether abnormalities in routine blood tests were associated with increased susceptibility to hearing loss induced by cisplatin chemotherapy. design: cohort study of patients with head and neck cancer receiving cisplatin chemotherapy who underwent audiometric testing. setting: a large, university-based hospital; part of a larger study regarding rehabilitation of patients with cancer. patients: forty-two patients with head and neck cancer who agreed to participate underwent at least three serial treatments with high-dose cisplatin therapy. routine blood tests and audiometric testing were performed before each course of chemotherapy. one hundred eighty audiograms were performed. outcome measures: a deterioration of auditory threshold of 15 db or more at one frequency or of 10 db or more at three or more frequencies was considered a significant loss. only frequencies at and below 4000 hz were considered. results: multiple analysis of variance results indicated that decreased serum albumin level, hemoglobin level, red blood cell count, and hematocrit were associated with an increased likelihood of significant hearing loss during chemotherapy. conclusions: patients in poor general medical condition with low levels of red blood cells or serum proteins are at increased risk for development of hearing loss from cisplatin chemotherapy. we recommend that hearing be tested before chemotherapy begins and after the first course of cisplatin. if there is no significant hearing loss at or below 4000 hz at that time, then subsequent audiometric testing is required only if symptoms of hearing loss develop.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:541-546)

progressive sensorineural hearing loss and a widened vestibular aqueduct in pendred syndrome. pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. obligatory features are profound deafness in childhood and defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. therefore, goiter is a common symptom. hypoplasia of the cochlea is another feature. recently, the gene for pendred syndrome was identified.we describe a boy whose sensorineural hearing loss in both ears progressed rapidly from about 50 to 60 db at the age of 3 years and 3 months to more than 100 db at the age of 4 years and 4 months. this loss was preceded by a medical history of a progressive hearing loss. the progressive nature of the hearing loss motivated a search for the cause. dysplasia of the cochlea and a widened vestibular aqueduct were found. the results of thyroid function tests were normal, but he had an elevated level of thyroglobulin. the diagnosis of pendred syndrome was confirmed by the positive results of a potassium perchlorate test, indicating defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. it is possible that the widened vestibular aqueduct was responsible for the increase in the hearing impairment. aside from the branchio-otorenal syndrome, pendred syndrome is the only other known genetic disorder with a widened vestibular aqueduct. if a child has progressive sensorineural deafness and a widened vestibular aqueduct, it is important to consider a diagnosis of pendred syndrome. a widened vestibular aqueduct may help to elucidate the pathophysiologic characteristics of hearing loss in these genetic types of deafness in childhood.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:501-505-->

polysomies of chromosomes 7 and 17 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. objective: to determine the polysomies (ie, cells with ¡Ý3 chromosome copies) of chromosomes 7 and 17 in tumor tissue, histologically normal epithelia adjacent to the tumor (tumor-adjacent epithelia), and buccal epithelia distant from the tumor (tumor-distant epithelia) of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. design: nonfluorescent, nonisotopic, in situ hybridization using chromosome-specific centromeric dna probes for chromosomes 7 and 17 was performed on the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from tumor and tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant epithelia of 19 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and from buccal epithelia of cancer-free control subjects who smoked and did not smoke cigarettes. main outcome measures: four hundred nuclei in tumor tissue and 200 nuclei in histologically normal epithelia were scored for hybridized signals in each sample. results: buccal epithelia of cancer-free control subjects who smoked and did not smoke cigarettes showed no difference in the polysomies of chromosomes 7 and 17, respectively. the polysomies of chromosomes 7 and 17 in the tumor cells were higher than those in the tumor-adjacent epithelia (p<.001 for both), tumor-distant epithelia (p<.001 for both), and buccal epithelia of cancer-free control subjects who smoked and did not smoke cigarettes (p<.001 for both). the polysomies of chromosomes 7 and 17 in the tumor-adjacent epithelia were higher than those in the tumor-distant epithelia (p<.001 for both) and the control buccal epithelia (p=.002 and p<.001, respectively). the tumor-distant epithelia and the control buccal epithelia for the polysomies of chromosomes 7 and 17 had no differences. conclusions: the finding of genotypic abnormalities in the tumor-adjacent epithelia supports the concept of field cancerization. such genotypic parameters may provide a genetic basis for the development of an early recurrence or second primary tumors after therapeutic treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1062-1067

suprahyoid and inferior constrictor release for laryngeal lowering. objective: to quantify accurately the suprahyoid and inferior constrictor releases, which are used to decrease tension across a tracheal anastomosis performed after tracheal resection. design: intraoperative tension measurements at 0.5-cm intervals of the released laryngotracheal unit were obtained using a spring balance after division of the trachea. subjects: a selected series of eight patients undergoing total laryngectomy for laryngeal carcinoma, excluding those with cervical soft-tissue involvement, tongue-base involvement, or a history of radiation therapy to the head and neck. results: the suprahyoid and inferior constrictor releases together permit a tension-free, inferior displacement of 2 cm. the suprahyoid release alone permits an inferior laryngotracheal displacement of 3.5 cm without exceeding the critical, anastomotic failure tension of 1700 g. using the releasing techniques together permits inferior displacement of 4 cm without notably exceeding this critical tension. conclusions: the closure of 2-cm defects without a releasing procedure is supported by this study. larger defects of 3.5 cm, and occasionally 4 cm, can be closed safely without exceeding the critical tension level using a suprahyoid release. this study supports the use of the suprahyoid and inferior constrictor releases together for the uncomplicated closure of 4-cm defects.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:1310-1313)

tubeless spontaneous respiration technique for pediatric microlaryngeal surgery. background: tubeless spontaneous respiration technique for pediatric microlaryngeal surgery may be accomplished using different anesthetic protocols. two methods, inhalation of volatile anesthetic agents alone and in combination with intravenous propofol, are reviewed with regard to intraoperative airway stability, post-operative morbidity, recovery room course, and halothane concentration required during maintenance anesthesia. design: retrospective case series. setting: otolaryngology referral hospital. patients and methods: twenty-nine microlaryngeal procedures were performed using tubeless spontaneous respiration technique in children ranging from 2 weeks to 11 years of age. the following 2 anesthetic protocols were used: inhaled volatile anesthetic agents alone in 18 procedures and in combination with intravenous propofol in 11. anesthesia, surgery, and recovery room times were documented. specific characteristics of anesthetic maintenance, including total anesthetic gas flow (liters per minute), variations of halothane concentration (percentage), and duration of halothane administration (minutes) were also recorded to calculate the mean concentration of halothane (percentage) delivered to each patient. results: no statistical differences were observed between the 2 protocols in terms of anesthesia and surgical outcomes. adjusting for differences in patient age, weight, maintenance duration, and total anesthetic gas flow, the introduction of propofol allowed a statistically significant reduction in the mean concentration of halothane required during maintenance anesthesia. conclusions: both tubeless spontaneous respiration technique protocols proved successful in this study. however, the addition of propofol allowed a significant reduction in the halothane requirement during anesthesia maintenance. this has the potential benefit of decreasing the exposure of operating room personnel to volatile anesthetics during tubeless spontaneous respiration technique.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:209-214

otitis media-reply. diagnostic instruments and methodologies have been sought for some time by investigators attempting to characterize the middle ear condition in the presence of an intact tympanic membrane. the presence of an acute serous effusion with air bubbles or an air-fluid meniscus makes the task relatively simple, but this condition is very uncommon in childhood chronic otitis media with effusion.to our knowledge, paradise et al1 were the first investigators to report a diagnostic paradigm for classifying tympanograms into a clinically useful scheme that would result in improved detection of middle ear effusion, the hallmark of chronic otitis media with effusion. they correlated their configurations with the presence of actual effusion at myringotomy. cantekin et al2 combined the tympanometric paradigm by paradise et al with otoscopy to further refine the algorithm for effusion detection. the article by brostoff and cantekin's3 further refined the original algorithm, a fluid-detection paradigm,

gastroesophageal reflux in patients with subglottic stenosis. objectives to determine the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with subglottic stenosis (sgs) and to determine if upper esophageal reflux occurs in addition to lower esophageal reflux in these patients. design esophageal ph probe studies were reviewed in patients diagnosed as having sgs. setting a tertiary care pediatric medical center. patients all patients diagnosed as having sgs between january 1990 and july 1996 who had undergone monitoring with an overnight esophageal ph probe. seventy-four patients qualified for the study. all 74 patients underwent lower probe testing, and 55 of the 74 underwent dual (upper and lower) probe testing. main outcome measures the percent of time a ph measurement of less than 4.0 was recorded in the upper and lower esophagus. a lower probe ph measurement of less than 4.0 more than 10% of the study time was considered high risk for developing reflux-associated pathologic symptoms. a lower probe ph measurement of less than 4.0 for 5% to 10% of the study time was considered a marginal risk for developing reflux-associated pathologic symptoms. upper probe criteria for reflux-associated symptoms have not been established. therefore, patients were grouped as having a ph of less than 4.0 in the upper esophagus for 0%, 0.1% to 0.9%, 1.0% to 1.9%, 2.0% to 3.0%, or more than 3% of the study time. results thirty-seven of the 74 patients who underwent lower probe testing had a ph of less than 4.0 more than 5% of the study time, and 24 had a ph of less than 4.0 more than 10% of the study time. twelve of the 55 patients who underwent upper probe testing had no measurable reflux; 27 of the 55 had a ph of less than 4.0 more than 1% of the study time; 14 had a ph of less than 4.0 more than 2% of the study time, and 11 had a ph of less than 4.0 more than 3% of the study time. conclusions gastroesophageal reflux is frequently present in patients with sgs. gastric contents frequently reach the upper and lower esophagus in these patients. in addition, the high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in these patients suggests that it may play a role in the development of sgs. the possible effect of gastroesophageal reflux on the surgical repair of sgs requires further study.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:551-555-->

clinical characteristics and genotype analysis of patients with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis requiring surgery. objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics and genotypes of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and nasal polyposis who require surgery. design: cross-sectional analysis of a large patient database. setting: data obtained from the national cf patient registry of the cystic fibrosis foundation, bethesda, md. patients: clinical and genotype data on 20 198 patients with cf who were registered in 1992 and 1993 were analyzed. the study group (n=815) consisted of patients with cf who had undergone surgical procedures for the treatment of nasal polyposis. the comparison group (n=19 383) comprised the remainder of the patients in the database. results: statistical analysis revealed that patients with cf and nasal polyposis who required surgery had better pulmonary function (higher percent-predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity), better nutritional status, a higher rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, more office visits, more hospitalizations, and a higher rate of acute exacerbations per year (p<.001 for each) than did the comparison group. among the patients who had mutation analysis performed, patients with nasal polyposis who required surgery were significantly associated with 2 specific genotypes: the ¦¤-f508/¦¤-f508 (57.5% vs 49.9%, p=.01) and the ¦¤-f508/g551d (12% vs 8%, p=.05) genotypes. conclusions: patients with cf and nasal polyposis who require surgery may constitute a clinical subgroup within the spectrum of the disease. these patients appear to have slightly better pulmonary function and nutritional status; yet, they seem to have a higher degree of health care utilization. the higher rate of p aeruginosa respiratory infection in this patient group suggests an association with the presence of nasal polyposis. genotype analysis showed a higher prevalence of the ¦¤-f508/¦¤-f508 and the ¦¤-f508/g551d genotypes in this patient group.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1209-1213

antibiotic treatment of children with secretory otitis media: amoxicillin-clavulanate is superior to penicillin v in a double-blind randomized study. objective: to compare the effect of 2 different antimicrobial agents in the treatment of secretory otitis media (som). design: prospective, double-blind, randomized study. patients: from a pool of 1450 children (aged 1-10 years) with som, defined by tympanometry as having type b or c2 tympanograms, 429 with som of at least 3 months' duration were included in the trial. after exclusion of 69 patients, the remaining 360 were evenly distributed among 4 treatment groups: penicillin v (primcillin) for 14 and 28 days, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in combination (spektramox) for 14 and 28 days. criteria for improvement was a change in tympanometric findings to type c1 or type a. results: the success rates were in favor of amoxicillin-clavulanate treatment for 28 days (p<.001) (rates for respective 14- and 28-day groups: penicillin v, 23% and 19%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 31% and 44%). antimicrobial therapy was more efficient (p<.001) in unilateral vs bilateral disease. conclusion: antibiotic treatment improves the middle ear status in patients with som, and amoxicillin-clavulanate provides superior improvement to penicillin v.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:695-699

radiotherapy vs total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation for oropharyngeal carcinoma-reply. thank you for giving me this opportunity to reply to parsons' comments. the decision to treat selected cases of t3, t4 tongue base carcinomas with a planned combined therapy was made at our center due to poor results obtained over a decade with radiotherapy alone. the superiority of combined therapy, ie, surgery followed by radiotherapy for t3, t4 oropharyngeal cancers, is well documented. most of these patients have multiple nodal metastases as well at the time of presentation. preservation of voice and swallowing in all cases is of significant benefit to the patients. loco-regional recurrences are a rarity. our patients not only returned to a normal life, but enjoy a quality of life never witnessed before. they have resumed their professions, like trucking, and pursue hobbies such as tennis and long-distance cycling. xerostomia is just one of the complications of radiotherapy that one encounters. we have seen patients treated with
