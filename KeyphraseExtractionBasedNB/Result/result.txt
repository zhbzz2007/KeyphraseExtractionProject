the liposhaver in facial plastic surgery-reply. we share dr shiffman's emphasis on the importance of safety in cosmetic surgery. as he points out, liposuction in the head and neck with blunt cannulas is relatively safe but is not completely without risk. sharp curettes and cannulas use a scraping motion; we have advised that the soft tissue shaver should not be used in this manner. the surgeon can use this instrument in a closed fashion, or, with the aid of an endoscope or a headlight, the surgeon can directly visualize the tissue as it is being shaved. to date, in a nearly 3-year combined experience, none of the authors have experienced damage to the surrounding nerves or vessels.liposuction is often inadequate for optimal removal of septated adipose tissue in the upper midline of the neck between the 2 anterior borders of the platysma muscle. many surgeons currently augment blunt liposuction in this area with

outcomes analysis of voice and quality of life in patients with laryngeal cancer. objective to assess relationships between voice satisfaction and global quality of life in patients who have been treated for laryngeal cancer. design cross-sectional survey study. setting veterans affairs medical center. patients eighty patients who had completed treatment for laryngeal cancer with either total laryngectomy (n=17), radiotherapy (n=24), or both (n=39). main outcome measures subscale scores on a general health status instrument (the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey), and a validated voice-specific functional status instrument (the voice handicap index). results self-rated global health did not correlate significantly with emotional, functional, or physical voice handicap, although some subscales on the 36-item short-form health survey correlated with voice handicap scores. global health status scores did not differ between patients who had undergone laryngectomy with a tracheoesophageal puncture and patients treated with radiotherapy only. physical voice handicap scores did not differ significantly between those who underwent tracheoesophageal puncture and those who had radiotherapy, but emotional (p=.07) and functional (p=.01) handicap scores were lower in patients treated with radiotherapy. however, there was considerable overlap in voice handicap scores, with many patients who had had tracheoesophageal puncture showing less voice handicap than patients treated with radiotherapy. conclusions these data demonstrate that health status is affected by other factors than voice handicap in patients with laryngeal cancer. in addition, there is a large amount of individual variation in voice handicap after treatment. these findings illustrate the need for prospective studies assessing voice handicap and quality of life after treatment for laryngeal cancer.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:143-148-->

reverse transcriptase in situ polymerase chain reaction in atypical mycobacterial adenitis. objective: to determine whether reverse transcriptase (rt) in situ polymerase chain reaction (pcr) can facilitate the diagnosis of nontuberculous ("atypical") mycobacterial (ntm) cervical adenitis. design: retrospective review of 12 patients with neck masses clinically diagnosed as ntm cervical adenitis. setting: university medical center caring for both ambulatory and hospitalized children. patients: twelve pediatric patients (all younger than 9 years) with cervicofacial masses. intervention: surgical excision of the presenting mass. main outcome measures: reverse transcriptase in situ pcr was used to detect mycobacterial rna in excised tissue. all specimens were also cultured and stained for acid-fast bacilli. results: reverse transcriptase in situ pcr was positive for ntm in 7 of 12 cases. conclusions: infection with ntm may be an extremely indolent process, and the success of rt in situ pcr depends on the presence of mycobacterial nucleic acids. even in cases in which the findings of rt in situ pcr were positive, infected cells were few in number. because of the sparsity of infection in the positive cases, ntm may be even more rare in the negative cases, ie, those in which mycobacterial nucleic acids do not exist and cannot be detected by any means, including rt in situ pcr. although rt in situ pcr, cultures, stains for acid-fast bacilli, and tuberculin tests using purified protein derivative are all helpful in diagnosing ntm cervical adenitis, when nucleic acids are present rt in situ pcr is the simplest, most reliable, and quickest to perform and the results are easiest to interpret.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1214-1218

swainsonine augments the cytotoxicity of human lymphokine-activated killer cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells. objective: swainsonine (sw), an inhibitor of mammalian golgi ¦Á-mannosidase ii, blocks the processing of high mannose to complex type oligosaccharides. in this study, the effect of sw on the cytotoxicity of lymphokine-activated killer (lak) cells against autologous thyroid cancer was investigated. design: peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with thyroid cancer were incubated with recombinant interleukin 2 (100 u/ml) and 0.5 mg/l of sw for 7 days, and thyroid cancer cells obtained from surgical specimens were pretreated with sw (0.5 mg/l) for 18 hours. the cytotoxicity of sw-treated lak cells against tumor cells tested in a standard 4-hour radioactive chromium cr 51 release assay. results: the cytotoxicity of sw-treated lak cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells was found to be significantly greater than that of standard lak cells incubated with interleukin 2 alone. the n-¦Á-benzyloxycarbonyl¨Cl-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase activity of lak cells, this activity being a cytotoxic factor that is necessary for the lethal hit stage, was also increased by sw treatment. further, thyroid cancer cells incubated with sw, as compared with nontreated tumor cells, showed much higher susceptibility to lak killing. conclusions: our results suggest that sw might have potential immunomodulatory properties in the treatment of thyroid cancer.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:389-394)

measurement of facial movement with computer software. objective to adapt desktop computer software to objectively grade facial movement. design the criteria of the facial nerve grading system by house and brackmann, the current "gold standard," are prone to ambiguous interpretation. proposed objective grading systems compare the movement of points on each side of the face or use subtraction and thresholding of digitized images of the face to yield images that represent moving areas of the face. the movement of a point on the face and the area of motion determined by digital subtraction were compared during an increasing smile in healthy subjects. the nottingham system (calculated using measurement of the movement of 4 points on the face) using desktop computer software (adobe photoshop 3.0, adobe systems inc, mountain view, calif) to measure movement of the points was compared with the system by house and brackmann. the computer software was used to subtract digitized images and derive a facial movement score, which was compared with the scores of the systems by nottingham and house and brackmann. setting academic otologic practice. study participants nine patients with varying degrees of facial nerve disability and 7 individuals with normal facial nerve function. results the movement of the oral commissure compared with the apparent area of movement of the face determined by digital subtraction had high intersubject variability. in patients with facial weakness, the nottingham score had a correlation coefficient of ?0.97 compared with the house and brackmann grade, and the digital subtraction score had a correlation coefficient of ?0.62 (paired student t test). conclusions the desktop computer software can be used to calculate the nottingham score. digital subtraction as a measure of facial function warrants further study.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:313-318-->

correlation of tumor markers p53, bcl-2, cd34, cd44h, cd44v6, and ki-67 with survival and metastasis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. background: recent basic discoveries about the biological significance of nuclear and cell-surface marker proteins have opened new areas of research into head and neck cancer. however, the clinical significance of these markers is not yet understood. objective: to perform a historical prospective study of 70 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx who were treated at our institution between 1979 and 1989 to correlate tumor marker expression with survival and metastasis. design: archival tissue was immunohistochemically stained for the p53 tumor suppressor gene product, the inhibitor of apoptosis (bcl-2), the stem cell marker cd34, the cell adhesion molecules cd44h and cd44v6, and a marker of cellular proliferation (ki-67). the slides were examined using a light microscope and scored according to intensity and percentage of cells labeled. the patients were stratified by tumor stage, and survival and metastatic data were correlated with staining scores. results: for the stage iv group, increased expression of p53 and decreased expression of cd44h and cd44v6 correlated with a decreased survival (p=.03, p=.03, and p=.02, respectively), and decreased expression of cd44h correlated with an increase in metastasis (p=.01). for all stages, excluding metastatic cases, increased p53 expression was consistent with a shorter survival (p<.03), while increased cd44v6 expression was consistent with a longer survival (p<.02). conclusions: the present study suggests that a loss of cell proliferation control implied by overexpression of p53 and loss of cell adhesion implied by decreased expression of cd44 may be determinants of survival in patients with carcinoma of the larynx. the tumor markers bcl-2 and ki-67 were not prognostic discriminators in this limited series. this study also indicates that the stem cell marker cd34 is rarely expressed by laryngeal carcinoma cells.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:627-632)

results of esophageal biopsies performed during triple endoscopy in the pediatric patient. background endoscopic examination (direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy) is the method of choice for diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of unknown cause in children. however, gastroesophageal reflux is being recognized increasingly often as a cause of pediatric respiratory symptoms and is difficult to diagnose on the basis of findings from direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. in cases in which gastroesophageal reflux was included in the differential diagnosis, we additionally performed esophagoscopy with esophageal mucosal biopsies. objectives to determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of routinely performing esophageal biopsies during triple endoscopy in children. methods twenty-four children ranging in age from 2 weeks to 10 years were referred for airway evaluation. under general anesthesia, children underwent direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy with mucosal biopsy. results esophageal mucosa biopsy specimens were quickly and safely obtained during endoscopic evaluation. there were no complications. reflux esophagitis was present in 54% of biopsy specimens, as suggested by basal cell hyperplasia, papillary elongation, and/or inflammatory cell infiltrates. conclusion gastroesophageal reflux is often difficult to diagnose in the pediatric population. when direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy is performed during examination of the child with airway symptoms, the addition of esophagoscopy with mucosal biopsies will safely and quickly provide data regarding the potential contribution of gastroesophageal reflux.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:545-549-->

septal perforation repair with acellular human dermal allograft. background connective tissue autografts are commonly used as interpositional grafts between septal flaps in the repair of septal perforations. the most common graft materials used include temporalis fascia and pericranium, both of which are accompanied by donor site morbidity, do not provide septal bulk, and are exceedingly thin and difficult to manage. objective to study the use of an acellular human dermal allograft (alloderm, lifecell corp, the woodlands, tex) as a connective tissue interpositional graft in septal perforation repair. setting private facial plastic surgery and reconstructive practice of 1 of the authors (r.w.h.k.), houston, tex, and the private and university practice of another author (h.f.), alexandria, egypt. patients twelve consecutive patients with septal perforation who received the acellular dermal allograft constituted this evaluation. the causes of the septal perforations were previous nasal surgery, previous nasal cautery, or cocaine use by the patient. design interposition grafting between mucoperichondrial flaps for septal perforation repair was accomplished with decellularized human dermal grafts. follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 14 months. main outcome measures the repair was considered successful when, on postoperative examination at 3 months, the right and left mucoperichondrial flaps were entirely healed. from the experience of 1 author (r.w.h.k.) with the repair of more than 75 septal perforations, no perforation that was healed at 3 months broke down at a later date, unless trauma or cocaine use occurred after the operation. an outcome was considered acceptable but nondesirable if a perforation was still present after the operation but the number and severity of the patient's symptoms were reduced and the perforation was considerably smaller than before the operation. results eleven of the 12 patients had successful outcomes with complete closure of their perforations. the 1 remaining patient had an acceptable result but incomplete closure; his initial perforation of 3 cm was reduced to 5 mm, making him asymptomatic after surgery. conclusion acellular human dermal grafts can be used as connective tissue interpositional grafts in the repair of septal perforations with success rates similar to the use of temporalis fascia, mastoid periosteum, or pericranium. one distinct advantage is the absence of donor-site morbidity. in addition, this graft material is thicker and easier to place and suture and may give more substance to the repaired septum.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:73-78-->

improved nasal breathing reduces snoring and morning tiredness: a 6-month follow-up study. background: dilation of the nasal valve region can increase the ability to breathe through the nose and reduce the negative intrathoracic pressure required for inspiration. vibrations of the palate and soft tissues of the throat, which generate snoring sounds, can be prevented when patients inhale less heavily. objectives: to evaluate the effect a nostril dilator has on patient snoring and tiredness in the morning and to determine how many patients would continue to use the device for half a year. design: for 6 months, 42 men who were heavy snorers graded their average tiredness in the morning and the patient's sleeping partner graded the average snoring using a visual analog scale from 0 to 100. setting: all patients were examined at the department of otorhinolaryngology, central hospital, in sk?vde, sweden. results: when the nostril dilator was used there was a significant decrease in snoring after both 1- and 6-month reports. there was a significant correlation between diminution of snoring and less tiredness in patients in the morning. the compliance was good since 60% of patients continued to use the device during the 6-month test period. conclusions: this study illustrates the benefits that reducing nasal airway resistance during sleep has on snoring and morning tiredness in patients.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1337-1340

fetal airway wound repair: a new frontier. purpose fetal dermal repair is regenerative and scarless until middle to late gestation, when there is a transition to fibrotic repair. fetal skeletal muscle and tendon undergo repair with fibrosis similar to the process in adults. this study addresses whether fetal mucosal healing is regenerative and scarless. methods anesthetized pregnant rabbits underwent laparotomy and controlled hysterotomy at 21 to 23 days' gestation (term is 31 days). a midline thyrotomy was made, followed by cricoidotomy and circumferential cauterization of the subglottic mucosa. a similar insult was applied to weanlings. the data were collected in 2 groups. one group was followed to term and killed at 4 weeks. a second group was killed after 6 days (30 days' gestation). the weanlings were killed at similar points. the larynges were harvested and processed for histological and morphometric analysis. results three litters were followed to term. of these, 1 was not recovered; in the other two, 7 of 8 manipulated fetuses were found and 3 of 8 were viable. the fourth litter was harvested after 6 days; all 4 injured fetuses were recovered and viable. all animals in the fetal injury groups healed with complete regeneration of the airway mucosa. in contrast, weanlings injured post partum had mucosal inflammation, necrosis, and ulceration; squamous metaplasia and basal cell hyperplasia were also found. there were fibrosis, granulation tissue, and inflammation in the lamina propria; chondritis, cartilaginous necrosis, chondrolysis, and perichondritis were also found. conclusions fetal airway mucosal healing is regenerative and, thus, scarless. this study provides further support for the thesis that skin and mucosa respond to injury similarly in both the developmental and postpartum stages, and that subglottic stenosis is reasonably thought of as the "hyperplastic scar" of the airway. these results have potential therapeutic applications for mucosal wound management.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:25-29-->

oromandibular reconstruction using microvascular composite flaps: report of 210 cases. objective to review the experience of 1 microvascular surgeon during an 11-year period in performing 210 vascularized bone-containing free flaps for oromandibular reconstruction. design retrospective medical records review of patients who underwent primary and secondary oromandibular reconstruction with the use of vascularized bone free flaps. setting academic medical center. patients a total of 201 patients underwent 210 composite free-flap reconstructions of the mandible for various disorders and with a range of bony and soft tissue defects. intervention all patients underwent the microvascular transfer of vascularized bone flaps from the ilium, fibula, or scapula. in selected cases, 2 simultaneous free flaps were transferred to achieve an optimal bone and soft tissue reconstruction. endosteal dental implants were used in 81 patients, with a total of 360 fixtures placed during these 11 years. main outcome measures the success of microvascular free tissue transfer, dental implant extrusion, and short- and long-term complications at the recipient and donor sites. results of the 210 mandibular reconstructions that were performed, 202 were successful in reestablishing mandibular continuity. reexploration for vascular-related complications was done in 16 patients, 8 of whom were successfully treated, yielding an overall success rate of 96%. the overall success rate for endosteal dental implants was 92%. the implant success rate was 86% when the bone in which the fixtures were placed was irradiated postoperatively. the success rate was 64% in the 14 fixtures that were placed into previously irradiated bone. conclusions the success of the use of vascularized bone free flaps in restoring continuity to the mandible is clearly demonstrated in this series. there was an acceptable incidence of donor- and recipient-site complications that resulted in minimal long-term morbidity. the careful selection of a donor site(s) for oromandibular reconstruction allows for an optimal restoration of bony and soft tissue defects. dental implants can be safely used in oromandibular reconstruction with a high level of success. placing these implants during the initial surgery shortens the duration for achieving dental rehabilitation and enhances the success of the implants when postoperative radiotherapy is administered.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:46-55-->

submucosal tumor extension in hypopharyngeal cancer. objectives: to study the incidence and extent of submucosal tumor extension in hypopharyngeal cancer and to evaluate the impact on the tumor recurrence and overall survival rates. method: fifty-seven resected specimens of hypopharyngeal cancer were studied in detail from january 1986 to december 1989 by use of the whole-organ, step¡ªserial sectioning technique. results: three types of submucosal tumor extension could be identified. type i extension was characterized by a tumor with a smooth round contour that extended submucosally. the mucosa was thereby elevated and was detectable on gross inspection at operation. in type ii extension, tongues and islands of tumor infiltrated within the submucosa, and these were not noticeable on gross examination. skip metastasis in the submucosa where the submucosal tumor was completely separated from the main tumor bulk was classified as type iii extension. thirty-three patients (58%) had submucosal tumor extension. the frequencies (and extents of submucosal tumor extension) in the superior, medial, lateral, and inferior directions were 16% (3-10 mm), 37% (2-37 mm), 26% (2-37 mm), and 28% (3-35 mm), respectively. two thirds of the submucosal extension was type i (22 of 33), and only 1 patient had a true skip lesion submucosally (type iii extension). type ii submucosal extension was found in one third of the patients (11 of 33). this occurred significantly more often in the patients who had received radiotherapy before surgery (82% 9/11]; p<.001; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-4.44). the presence of submucosal tumor extension had no effect on the tumor recurrence and overall survival rates. conclusions: the incidence of submucosal tumor extensions in hypopharyngeal cancer is high (58%), but most (67%) of them can be detected grossly at operation. the presence of submucosal tumor extension does not adversely affect the survival and tumor recurrence rates.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:959-965

characteristics of tinnitus induced by head injury. objective: to determine if the characteristics of tinnitus produced by head trauma are specific and exclusive when compared with other origins of tinnitus. design: retrospective study using clinic test results and data from the tinnitus data registry compiled from questionnaires, interviews, and testing. tinnitus produced by head injury was compared with tinnitus of mixed origins, including no known origin. setting: a tinnitus referral clinic where all patients must see an otologist or an ear, nose, and throat physician prior to attending the clinic. patients: all patients had severe to moderately severe constant tinnitus and presented with tinnitus as the primary symptom. results: no exclusive characteristics were found to describe head injury¨Cinduced tinnitus. the tinnitus for the group with head injury was statistically significantly (p=.004) louder and occurred with greater incidence of continuing pain in the ears. the group with head injury also had more episodes of dizziness and a more severe form of tinnitus. however, no marked difference was noted in pitch of tinnitus, complexity (number of sounds) of tinnitus, or the minimum masking level. conclusions: this retrospective study found that tinnitus induced by head injury was significantly (p=.004) louder than tinnitus induced from other causes but, interestingly, did not require higher levels of masking. the patients with head injury¨Cinduced tinnitus more frequently (p=.0003) displayed residual inhibition although the duration of residual inhibition was not different from that of the comparison group. other symptoms associated with the tinnitus onset were more frequently mentioned by the group with head trauma¨Cinduced tinnitus, except for the condition of pressure sensation in the ears. using a severity questionnaire, the group with head trauma¨Cinduced tinnitus rated their tinnitus as being more severe than did the comparison group. however, such things as pitch of the tinnitus, masking level, acceptance of wearable maskers, general hearing level, and complexity of the tinnitus did not distinguish the two groups.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:547-551)

international genetic workshop on crouzon disease and other craniofacial disorders, pittsburgh, pa, march 10-11, 1995. facial appearance identifies an individual and instantly creates an impression on the observer. abnormal facial features challenge affected individuals both socially and medically. these patients are at risk of developing problems, eg, communication, hearing, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic sinusitis. otolaryngologists should be aware of recent advances in molecular genetics as it affects craniofacial abnormalities.through familial linkage analyses and candidate gene sequencing studies, substantial progress has been achieved recently in understanding the genetic basis of human craniofacial development. mapping the gene for crouzon craniofacial dysostosis (cfd) to 10q25-261 led to the discovery that some patients with cfd had mutations in the fibroblast growth factor (fgf) receptor gene (fgfr2).2 the fgfr2 mutations were also shown to be responsible for the jackson-weiss,3 apert,4 and some cases of pfeiffer5 syndromes. pfeiffer syndrome, however, was demonstrated to be heterogeneous as mutations in fgfr1 (chromosome 8) were found in

first branchial cleft anomalies: a study of 39 cases and a review of the literature. objectives to identify the clinical and anatomical presentations and to discuss the guidelines for surgical management of anomalies of the first branchial cleft. design retrospective study. setting three tertiary care centers. patients thirty-nine patients with first branchial cleft anomalies operated on between 1980 and 1996. intervention all patients were treated surgically. complete removal of the lesion required superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection in 36 cases. the relationship of the facial nerve and anomalies is discussed. results anatomically, 3 types of first branchial cleft anomalies are identified: fistulas (n=11), sinuses (n=20), and cysts (n=8). clinically, 3 types of presentation are noted: chronic purulent drainage from the ear (n=12), periauricular swelling in the parotid area (n=18), and abscess or persistent fistula in the neck located above a horizontal plane passing through the hyoid bone (n=21). a membranous attachment between the floor of the external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane was observed in 10% of cases. the facial nerve was located lateral to the anomaly in 39% of cases. conclusions before definitive surgery, many patients (n=17) underwent incision and drainage for infection owing to the difficulties in diagnosing this anomaly. wide exposure is necessary in most cases, and a standard parotidectomy incision allows adequate exposure of the anomaly and preservation of the facial nerve. complete removal without complications depends on a good understanding of regional embryogenesis, a knowledge of the circumstances surrounding discovery, an awareness of the different anatomical presentations, and a readiness to identify and protect the facial nerve during resection.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:291-295-->

otologic manifestations of wolf-hirschhorn syndrome. objective to determine if haploinsufficiency for chromosome 4p16.3 in wolf-hirschhorn syndrome (whs) is associated with cochlear hearing loss. design case series. setting tertiary care center. patients six patients with whs were identified through a database and charts were retrospectively reviewed. main outcome measures presence of sensorineural hearing loss as assessed by brainstem auditory evoked response. results one of the 6 patients had sensorineural hearing loss. three of the 6 patients had chronic otitis media with effusion and underwent bilateral tympanostomy tube placement; 2 of these 3 had cleft lip and palate, and 1 had a bifid uvula. one of the 6 patients had spontaneous nystagmus. five of the 6 patients had preauricular and/or auricular abnormalities. conclusions more than 25 genes for nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment have been mapped. one of these genes, dfna6, was identified through linkage analysis of a family with dominant, progressive, low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. dfna6 maps to chromosome 4p16.3, a region that is partially deleted in patients with whs. in our series, we identified the second patient with whs in the literature with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. the incidence and type of otologic findings are consistent with those reported in the literature. analysis of patients with chromosomal rearrangements represents one strategy toward identifying candidate genes for genetic hearing impairment.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:193-196-->

enlarged vestibular aqueduct and sensorineural hearing loss in childhood. objective: to determine if all children with enlarged vestibular aqueducts (evas) have development of uniform progressive sensorineural hearing loss (snhl). to determine whether the size of the eva correlates with severity, frequencies involved, and stability of snhl. to determine if the audiologic pattern of snhl correlates with likelihood of progression of snhl. design: retrospective study. setting: children's national medical center, washington, dc, a tertiary care center with a large otologic practice. patients: fifteen children (26 ears) with eva on computed tomographic scan. methods: history, physical examination, computed tomographic scans, and serial audiograms were reviewed. factors analyzed included age at diagnosis, audiometric configuration (high tone, midtone, low tone, flat), degree of hearing loss at presentation, length of follow-up, and presence of associated inner ear anomalies. results: nine ears had progressive snhl, 16 ears had stable snhl, and 1 ear had profound snhl. the predominant audiologic configuration was flat. the audiogram configuration does not correlate with progression of snhl. the size of the vestibular aqueduct does not correlate with the level, type, or progression of snhl. conclusion: our study failed to uncover factors that might be predictive of progression of hearing loss. we conclude that until a better understanding of the natural history and pathophysiologic condition of evas is achieved, there is no surgical or other intervention that can be demonstrated as being efficacious(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:23-28)

reverse gullibility and scientific evidence. a 19th century image of the medical profession's attitude toward disease transmission is introduced through ignaz semmelweis' hypothesis: infection can be caused by an external agent transmitted when physicans fail to sterilize their hands between patient examinations. semmelweis' test of his hypothesis reduced the obstetrical death rate from 18% to almost 1%. however, he was degraded, defrocked, and driven to death by a profession whose emotions contradicted the evidence. medical professionals like to believe they are not gullible, a trait defined as being easily duped. they rightly believe in their ability to avoid the error of accepting a result not supported by adequate evidence. they are not so free of the complementary error: refusing to accept a result that is supported by adequate evidence, which might be thought of as reverse gullibility. it is just as bad a logical error and just as serious a denial of the best medical care for our patients. clearly semmelweis, and later louis pasteur and others who were disbelieved, were correct. the profession was duped by its emotional adherence to current practice. to be truly professional, let us believe our evidence rather than our biases and not suffer from reverse gullibility.

antioxidant levels in the nasal mucosa of patients with chronic sinusitis and healthy controls. background: imbalances between oxidant formation and antioxidative defense are associated with the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory disorders of the respiratory tract. therefore, a role of oxidative stress in chronic upper airway tract infections can be anticipated. objective: to determine if patients with chronic sinusitis demonstrate a reduced antioxidative tissue status. design: the levels of 3 biologically important antioxidants, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione, uric acid, and vitamin e, were determined biochemically in mucosal biopsy specimens from the uncinate process of patients with chronic sinusitis and healthy controls. subjects: inflamed mucosa samples were obtained from 9 patients with chronic sinusitis during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. normal mucosa samples were collected from 10 healthy controls during surgery for nasal obstruction. results: the data (presented as mean¡Àsd) show a significant reduction (p¡Ü.05) of reduced glutathione levels (0.3¡À0.1 ¦Ìmol/g wet weight) and uric acid levels (2.7¡À0.4 ¦Ìmol/g wet weight) in mucosa samples obtained from patients with chronic sinusitis compared with healthy controls (0.6¡À0.2 and 3.4¡À0.6 ¦Ìmol/g wet weight, respectively). no difference was found in oxidized glutathione (24¡À8 vs 25¡À15 nmol/g wet weight) and vitamin e (20.5¡À7.9 vs 22.5¡À6.9 nmol/g wet weight) levels between both groups. conclusions: decreased levels of both reduced glutathione and uric acid in patients with chronic sinusitis lead to a diminished antioxidant defense, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract disorders. the vitamin e level seems less important. this finding may offer perspectives for pharmacotherapeutic intervention with antioxidants.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:201-204

pathological findings of the facial nerve in a case of facial nerve palsy associated with benign parotid tumor. the presence of facial nerve palsy associated with an ipsilateral parotid tumor is virtually pathognomonic for a malignant parotid tumor. however, several case reports have documented the occurrence of facial nerve palsy caused by benign parotid lesions. a case of warthin's tumor causing facial nerve palsy is presented and discussed histologically. to our knowledge, histological examination of the nerve bundles has never before been reported. the histological findings suggest that ischemia of the nerve caused by external compression resulted in facial nerve palsy.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:410-412)

the use of processed allograft dermal matrix for intraoral resurfacing: an alternative to split-thickness skin grafts. background the standard reconstruction of significant mucosal defects in head and neck surgery has been split-thickness skin grafting (stsg). objective to examine the use of a commercially available acellular dermal matrix as an alternative to stsg to reduce the scarring and contracture inherent to meshed split-thickness autografting and avoid the additional donor site morbidity. patients and methods twenty-nine patients with full-thickness defects of the oral cavity were included in this retrospective chart review. candidate patients had their operative procedure performed at a tertiary care center during a 24-month period. allograft dermal matrix, an acellular tissue-processed biomaterial, was applied to these intraoral defects. the defects were reconstructed with an acellular dermal graft matrix in the same technical fashion as with an autologous skin graft. patients were evaluated for rate of "take," functional return time to reepithelialization, average surface area of graft, associated pain and discomfort, evidence of restrictive graft contracture, patient diagnosis, and graft location within the oral cavity. any evidence of incomplete graft reepithelialization was considered grounds for graft failure, either complete or incomplete. epithelialization and contracture were assessed during outpatient clinical examinations. patient complaints with regard to discomfort at the graft bed were considered evidence of pain. results graft locations included 9 in the tongue (32%), 5 in the maxillary oral vestibule (17%), 4 in the mandible (14%), 4 in the floor of mouth (14%), 3 in the hard and/or soft palate (10%), 3 in the tonsil (10%), and 1 in the lip (3%). the overall rate of take was 90% with complete epithelialization noted on clinical evaluation within 4 weeks. patients were followed up for an average of 8.6 months. the average grafted surface area was 25 cm2. pain or discomfort was noted in 3 patients (12%). one patient (4%) was noted to have clinical evidence of graft contracture. conclusions allograft dermal matrix was successful as a substitute to autologous stsg for resurfacing of intraoral defects. allograft dermal matrix may be considered a useful reconstructive option for patients with oral mucosal defects.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:1201-1204-->

american society of pediatric otolaryngology news. in the april 1993 issue of the archives, the american society of pediatric otolaryngology news section featured various opinions on the use of audiograms prior to polyethylene tube placement in children. in response, we received a letter questioning the feasibility of hearing testing in young children. below is a review of behavioral hearing testing in children.children are complex and each unique in their specific behavior and development. otitis media can have many different effects on the behavior and development of children, such as delay in speech and language skills, shortened attention span, behavior problems, poor eating, and disrupted sleeping patterns. a hearing evaluation provides valuable information for the treatment of the child with otitis media. hearing levels may vary from very slight to moderate, and the degree of hearing impairment is tied to the degree of impact on other areas of development. behavioral testing is the most cost-effective, noninvasive

treatment evaluation in otitis media research. objective: an application of the clinical otitis media profile is proposed for the evaluation of treatments in clinical studies of otitis media. methods: methods include a statistical test of significance and measures of "treatment difference." this article focuses on the method, not any particular study; however, an example is given to illustrate the ideas. conclusions: the proposed method substantially increases powers of statistical tests, as compared with the use of a two-point scale algorithm, when applied to study changes of the middle ear condition over time or to compare treatment effects. the proposed evalution method is applicable to any medical drug treatment for groups that may not be comparable, even with randomization, for baseline severity. applied to surgical treatment, it can be used for long-term evaluation; however, short-term evaluation is impossible because the needed tympanometric, static admittance, and width measurements cannot be obtained in the presence of functioning tubes. to achieve this objective, it is necessary to use another profile or diagnostic procedure.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:507-509)

modified bernard-burow cheek advancement and cross-lip flap for total lip reconstruction. subtotal lip reconstruction can be performed using local flaps such as the cross-lip flap or fan flap. total lip reconstructive efforts usually are suboptimal in providing an adequate oral sphincter, an acceptable aesthetic result, or both. for total upper, lower, or extensive combined soft-tissue defects that include both lips, traditional methods of reconstruction include the use of regional flaps. more contemporary reconstructive efforts emphasize staged reconstruction with local tissue flaps using "like" tissue in a sequential fashion to achieve a successful outcome. we describe the reconstruction of total upper, lower, or extensive combined defects and report on 7 cases using a 2-staged method of reconstruction based on the modifications of the bernard-burow and abbe flaps. the principle of esthetic units an intact modiolus and oral sphincter are emphasized to ensure excellent aesthetic and functional results.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1253-1258

laryngeal aerodynamic aspects of women with adductor spasmodic dysphonia. objective: to determine if laryngeal aerodynamic parameters distinguish the voice of patients diagnosed as having adductor spasmodic dysphonia (sd) from individuals with normal voice production. design: a group comparison between 10 women diagnosed as having adductor sd and 10 women with no evidence of vocal abnormalities or vocal dysfunction. setting: university and university-affiliated health center. patients: ten women (age range, 38 through 82 years) diagnosed as having adductor sd and 10 age-matched women (¡À 2 years) with no evidence of pathologic vocal features or vocal dysfunction. results: multivariate statistical analysis revealed significantly higher values for amplitude-based glottal airflow measures of maximum flow declination rate, peak glottal airflow, and minimum glottal airflow. conclusions: spasmodic dysphonia affects the ability of the laryngeal mechanism to function effectively. to date, few empirical studies have examined glottal airflow characteristics associated with adductor sd. results from our study demonstrate that certain amplitude-based glottal airflow parameters distinguish adductor sd from normal voice. therefore, aerodynamic measures may offer additional objectivity for the study of sd.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:385-388)

the endoscopic approach to the pituitary gland. we present the use of the rigid sinus endoscope for the removal of two benign pituitary neoplasms. after a search of the relevant literature it appears that the use of the rigid endoscope has been confined to surgical procedures on the paranasal sinuses. with the addition of the techniques of endoscopic sinus surgery to this interface of otolaryngology and neurosurgery, we believe an alternative to transseptal or traditional transsinal procedures has been introduced.both patients who underwent pituitary gland resection for benign adenoma presented with visual complaints prompting discovery of the tumors. appropriate endocrinologic consultation was obtained before surgery. septoplasty was not required in either patient. the procedures were performed with the patients under general anesthesia with the use of topical and injectable anesthetic solutions as with other endoscopic procedures. the first patient developed a cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea on the third postoperative day that was repaired with endoscopic application of

the early history of the neurofibromatoses: evolution of the concept of neurofibromatosis type 2. although neurofibromatosis (nf) became widely recognized as a pathologic entity in the late 19th century, only relatively recently has a clear distinction been made between its generalized form and the central variety. the latter form is typified by bilateral acoustic neuromas (ans), which may be accompanied by other intracranial tumors, in particular, meningiomas. up until almost the current era, confusion regarding the protean manifestations of the 2 types of nf existed in the minds of clinicians and in the literature. in 1987, a consensus panel of the national institutes of health differentiated the clinical manifestations associated with classic von recklinghausen syndrome from those of the predominantly intracranial subtype and they were subsequently deemed nf type 1 (nf-1) and nf type 2 (nf-2), respectively. during the last few years, the genetic flaws that underlie these 2 syndromes have been elucidated, revealing that their origins lie in defects on separate chromosomes. the early literature on the subject included repeated descriptions of patients with manifestations typical of nf-2. the investigators, however, considered the intracranial lesions to be merely 1 facet of the generalized form of the disease. a few prescient individuals, however, demonstrated an appreciation for the distinguishing characteristics between these superficially similar, yet quite different, syndromes. the goals of this article are to trace the evolution of the concept of nf-2 as a distinct clinical entity from nf-1 and to assess the early awareness of and attitudes toward bilateral ans, familial ans, and ans associated with other intracranial tumors.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1240-1249

prior authorship. this is a comment on a prior letter regarding authorship1 that appeared in the june 1994 issue of the archives regarding an article by catalano and biller.2the original english description of the extended maxillotomy procedure was by hernandez-altemir of zaragoza, spain.3 he had previously published this technique in a spanish journal in 1982 and 1983.4,5 a scholarly review of all the world's literature would have turned up this article by hernandez-altemir. maybe then it would not have been reintroduced as a new procedure by three different studies.1,6,7this episode brings to mind several problems that are becoming more apparent to readers of the otolaryngology literature. some of it may be related to our increasing reliance on computer literature searches. if the key words used in searches do not match with similar articles, these articles will be omitted in the search results. i think this

vascular anatomy of the nose and the external rhinoplasty approach. i congratulate toriumi et al1 for their nice study on the vascular anatomy of the nose. however, i find fault with the nomenclature used under the description of the lymphatic and nodal drainage as depicted in figures 11 through 13. previous studies date back to the classical treatise on the anatomy of the human lymphatic system by henri rouvierre.2 figure 5 in this volume clearly describes the lymphatics of the nose distributed as external and internal lymphatics.2(p66) the external lymphatics arise from 2 papillary networks: (1) a superficial, cutaneous and (2) a deep, originating in the muscles, periosteum, and perichondrium of the region. the superficial, cutaneous network follows a superficial path or a deep path. whichever path is followed, the collecting trunks accompany the external maxillary blood vessels (facial blood vessels) at the inferior part of the face and terminate in prevascular and retrovascular submaxillary lymph nodes.

sudden sensorineural hearing loss and hemostatic mechanisms. objective: to evaluate the possible causal role of pathologic hemostatic mechanisms in sudden hearing loss. design: the study was prospective. setting: the patients were hospitalized, and all tests were performed at the hospital. patients: thirty-two consecutive patients with sudden hearing loss participated, as well as a control group of 28 healthy individuals. the control group was matched with regard to body mass index. main outcome measures: venous blood analyses were made regarding general blood parameters, as well as specific hemostatic parameters. results: twenty-five of the patients had some kind of aberration of specific hemostasis parameters; seven patients had an increase in the activity of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (ie, a glycoprotein associated with diminished fibrinolysis) compared with that in the control group (p<.05). increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels were most frequently observed among the patients who were overweight. seven of the oldest patients had an increase of d-dimers, ie, a degradation product of fibrin, and most of these patients had a history of cardiovascular disease. conclusion: although isolated aberrations in the hemostatic pathway were observed, we concluded that pathologic hemostasis does not seem to have a decisive importance for the pathogenesis of sudden deafness.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:536-540)

cytokines, immunoglobulins, and bacterial pathogens in middle ear effusions. objective: to elucidate the role of cytokines, immunoglobulins, and bacterial pathogens in the middle ear effusions (mees) of children with otitis media (om). design: paired mees and serum samples collected from consecutive patients were assayed for immunoglobulins. middle ear effusions were cultured for bacterial pathogens and assayed for interleukin-1¦Â, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor a, and interferon y. the medical charts of the patients were retrospectively reviewed to define the history of om. subjects: seventy-five patients with a history of recurrent acute om, persistent om with effusion, or both. exclusion criteria included the presence of a major coexisting condition, or an unclear or atypical history of om. setting: a private practice at a tertiary care children's hospital. interventions: at the time of tympanostomy tube place-ment, with the patient under general anesthesia, one mee and a serum sample were collected. results: interleukin-1¦Â was detected in 58% (44/75) mees; interleukin-6, 83% (60/72); tumor necrosis factor a, 38% (38/75); and interferon y, 61% (45/74). concentrations of interleukin-1¦Â, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor ¦Á in mees were highly correlated with each other (p<.01 for each association) suggesting increased local production and the expected effects of cytokines stimulating their own production during om. high concentrations of tumor necrosis factor a in mees were also associated with a history of multiple placements of tympanostomy tubes (r=.63). conclusions: these data suggest a regulatory role for cytokines in inflammation during om, and suggest that high concentrations of tumor necrosis factor a in mees may be a marker for om chronicity.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:865-869)

effect of resection margins on dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans of the head and neck. objective: to determine clinical and surgical factors that affect the recurrence of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans of the head and neck. design: retrospective case series of 32 patients who were seen between 1960 and 1995 with a diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans of the head and neck. data extracted from patient records included sex, age at diagnosis, tumor site, presence or absence of tumor-free margins, initial and salvage treatment, time to recurrence, and status after last treatment. setting: academic tertiary care referral center. intervention: surgical excision and radiation therapy. results: univariate kaplan-meier analysis for recurrence showed the difference in survival to be statistically significant (p<.05) between patients who had wide (¡Ý2 cm) surgical margins vs those who had close (<2 cm) margins. univariate kaplan-meier analysis for recurrence with or without radiation as the grouping variable showed the difference to be statistically significant (p<.01). similar analyses with sex, age, tumor site, and size of tumor as the grouping variables were not statistically significant. multivariate cox regression analysis was used with sex, age, and close or wide margins as variables. close margins (<2 cm) had a statistically significant positive correlation with recurrence (p<.05), while sex and age were not associated with recurrence. conclusion: surgical margins of at least 2 cm should be used in all cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans of the head and neck to prevent recurrence.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:430-433

interleukins 2 and 12 activate natural killer cytolytic responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. objectives: to examine the capacity of interleukin-2 (il-2) and interleukin-12 (il-12) to modulate the cytolytic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells against squamous cell carcinoma, and to determine whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors respond differently to il-12 than do peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. design: case-comparison study of a consecutive sample of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who were scheduled to undergo surgical excision. participants: the study included 10 patients with stage iii or iv carcinoma matched with 10 volunteer blood donors. intervention: isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients and volunteers were treated with il-2, 10 u/ml and 100 u/ml; il-12,1 u/ml or 10 u/ml; or a combination of il-2 and il-12. results: the combination of il-2 and il-12 consistently produced the greatest activation of cytolysis than either cytokine alone at all concentrations tested. this increased activity against a squamous cell carcinoma cell line was seen in lymphocytes from volunteers and patients. conclusion: our findings suggest a new treatment regimen for the patient with head and neck cancer that uses immunomodulation with a combination of cytokines.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:541-547)

traumatic optic neuropathy: a meta-analysis. background: the management of traumatic optic neuropathy remains controversial. reports of improvement have been published after observation alone, treatment with corticosteroids, and surgical decompression. objective: to systematically review the published literature about traumatic optic neuropathy using a meta-analysis. methods: we performed a retrospective literature review of case series and case reports of traumatic optic neuropathy. these include all english language cases and selected non-english language cases for which patient data were available. the cases were organized into four grades based on visual acuity and the locations and type of fracture. grade 1 included patients with visual acuity greater than 20/200 in the affected eye and without a posterior orbit fracture; grade 2, patients with visual acuity between 20/200 and light perception; grade 3, patients without light perception or with a nondisplaced posterior orbital fracture and remaining vision; and grade 4, patients with no light perception and a displaced posterior orbital fracture. a meta-analysis was performed, analyzing for each case the recovery of visual acuity for treatment, fracture pattern, and grade. results: the recovery of vision in treated patients was significantly better than the recovery in patients receiving no treatment. no significant difference in improvement was found among patients treated with corticosteroids alone, with surgical decompression alone, or with corticosteroids and surgical decompression. recovery was related to the severity of initial injury, as reflected in the grading system. a trend was noted for better improvement of visual acuity in patients without orbital fractures than those with orbital fractures, and also in patients with anterior orbital fractures than in patients with posterior orbital fractures. conclusions: treatment with corticosteroids, extracranial decompression, or both, is better than no treatment of traumatic optic neuropathy. because the data are insufficient to determine whether corticosteroids, surgery, or use of both treatments is most effective, the findings of the ongoing international optic nerve trauma study should prove valuable. the standardized grading system we developed is a useful tool for comparing studies and treatment protocols.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:389-392)

ciprofloxacin-reply. tutkun is right in observing a very significant difference in the dosage reported in our two studies. the exact concentration of ciprofloxacin that we used in both studies was 250 ¦Ìg/ml, which we obtained dissolving the pure powder of ciprofloxacin in saline solution. the only difference concerning the dosage was in the quantity of drops used: the first study mentioned three drops and the second study mentioned four drops according to the further suggestions of ear, nose, and throat specialists who were participating in the study.i am sorry for the misunderstanding. it was my fault as in the original manuscript that i sent to the archives it was a typographic mistake (both in the "materials and methods" and in the "comment" sections) where 250 mg/ml instead of 250 ¦Ìg/ml was mentioned. i did not notice this error even when i verified the page proofs of the article.

long-term effects of chronic otitis media on binaural hearing in children. objective: to determine the long-term effect of otitis media with effusion (ome) on binaural hearing in children. design: longitudinal testing over a 4-year period following insertion of tympanic membrane grommets, employing clinical and normal control groups. subjects: twenty-two children with a history of ome were tested before insertion of grommets and at 3 months and 1 year after surgery; 14, 11, and 8 of the children were followed up for 2, 3, and 4 years after surgery, respectively. an age-matched control group of 40 children was tested. methods: the masking-level difference (mld) paradigm was used to measure the ability of the binaural auditory system to aid the detection of a pure-tone signal presented in a random masking noise. results: although the results indicated a significant improvement in the mld with increasing time after middle ear surgery, the mld remained significantly reduced even 2 years after hearing threshold correction. the mlds of the ome group did not differ significantly from those of the control group when tested 3 years after middle ear surgery, even though a small proportion of subjects with a history of ome continued to have mlds smaller than normal limits. conclusion: in general, the results suggest a slow recovery of binaural function in children with ome after restoration of normal hearing thresholds.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:847-852)

multicentric eighth cranial nerve schwannoma. to our knowledge, only 3 histopathologically proved cases of multicentric eighth cranial nerve schwannoma have been described in the literature since 1981. we describe a patient with 2 isolated eighth cranial nerve schwannomas arising separately from the left cochlea and internal auditory canal. these 2 tumors were diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging prior to resection, and the diagnosis was further confirmed by intraoperative findings and histopathologic analysis. the genetic molecular basis and clinical features of this rare tumor have been overlooked. the value of the transotic approach for total tumor removal is emphasized.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:650-653

laryngeal abductor reinnervation with a phrenic nerve transfer after a 9-month delay. background successful restoration of laryngeal abductor function, using the phrenic nerve, has been described in the cat model in the acute phase. however, in clinical practice there is usually a considerable delay between injury to the rln and presentation for treatment. delayed reinnervation therefore would be more suitable in clinical practice. objective to test the feasibility of delayed selective abductor reinnervation following transection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (rln). materials and methods in 12 cats, the right rln was severed. nine months later, the phrenic nerve was anastomosed to the distal rln stump with all its branches directed toward the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. for 10 weeks after the reconstruction, electromyography and videolaryngoscopy were performed weekly. finally, histological analysis of the rln was performed. results evaluation was possible in 11 cats. reinnervation of the right posterior cricoarytenoid muscle with the phrenic nerve occurred in 10 cats following nerve anastomosis, but results of videolaryngoscopy showed adequate to good abduction in only 4 cats. the main limiting factor was reduced mobility of the cricoarytenoid joint. evidence of spontaneous subclinical reinnervation after the delay was observed in 7 cats but apparently did not impede the surgical reinnervation. conclusions delayed selective laryngeal abductor reinnervation was feasible, but function recovery was less successful than if performed immediately. future investigations should concentrate on early determinants of spontaneous restoration of function to allow early selection of patients who are eligible for reinnervation surgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:393-398-->

an assessment of prognostic factors in soft-tissue sarcoma of the head and neck. objective: this study evaluates the outcome, patterns of failure, and prognostic factors in head and neck softtissue sarcoma in the adult. design: a retrospective evaluation of 73 patients treated recently for this rare disease. the minimum follow-up for all patients was 3 years with the living patients having a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. setting: all patients were treated between january 1980 and december 1988, at the princess margaret hospital¨Contario cancer institute, toronto, the major sarcoma referral center for a population in excess of 3 million. patients or participants and interventions: fifty-two patients were treated with curative intent: 10 by surgery without radiotherapy and 42 with surgery and radiotherapy. twelve patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. outcome measures: five-year cause-specific survival, local relapse, and distant failure rates were calculated by the product limit method. comparisons between survival curves were carried out by the log-rank statistic and cox regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of prognostic factors. results: the 5-year cause-specific survival was 62%, with a local relapse rate of 41% and distant relapse rate of 31%. extension to adjacent structures, high grade, and large lesion size were associated with poorer survival. gross residual tumor also was associated with high local failure (75% failure) despite the addition of radiation therapy. those with clear surgical margins or only microscopic involvement fared much more favorably and had similar local control rates (26% and 30% failure, respectively) provided adjuvant radiotherapy was given. however, 68% of patients dying as a result of their sarcoma had uncontrolled local disease because of the high incidence (27%) of gross residuum following surgery in this series. conclusions: this series highlights the absolute necessity for resection of all overt disease with planned adjunctive radiotherapy and appropriate reconstruction in most cases. this is achieved more easily in the setting of a specialized sarcoma treatment unit.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:981-986)

the functional role of the tonsils in speech. objective: to present illustrative cases showing various tonsillar influences on speech and to present a clinical method for patient evaluation establishing concepts of management and a rational therapeutic approach. design: the cases were selected from a group of approximately 1000 patients referred to the clinic because of suspected palatal diseases. complete velopharyngeal assessment was made, including otolaryngologic, speech, and hearing examinations, polysomnography, nasendoscopy, multiview videofluoroscopy, and cephalometry. results: new observations further elucidate the intimate relation between the tonsils and the velopharyngeal valve. the potential influence of the tonsils on the velopharyngeal valve mechanism, in hindering or assisting speech, is described. conclusions: in selected cases, the decision to perform tonsillectomy depends on its potential effect on speech. the combination of nasendoscopic and multiview videofluoroscopic studies of the mechanical properties of the tonsils during speech is required for patients who present with velopharyngeal insufficiency in whom tonsillar hypertrophy is found. these studies are also required in patients with palatal anomalies who are candidates for tonsillectomy.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:846-851)

overexpression of cyclin d1 indicates a poor prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. objectives: to evaluate the overexpression of cyclin d1 and p53 as a prognostic marker of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and to investigate whether deregulation of these genes is associated with an unfavorable course of disease. design: retrospective study. materials and methods: formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor materials that were obtained from a well-characterized series of 115 patients with resectable head and neck cancer at the netherlands cancer institute, amsterdam, were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods using antiserum samples that were directed against 2 proteins (ie, cyclin d1 and p53), which are crucial in the regulation of the g1 phase of the cell cycle. results: overexpression of cyclin d1 protein was found in 49% of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. this overexpression was not associated with known prognostic factors (eg, the t and n stages). tumors recurred more frequently and in a shorter period in patients whose primary tumors showed an overexpression of cyclin d1 protein. this difference (p=.05) was statistically significant in a stepwise proportional hazard regression analysis. however, since a discrepancy in staining results was observed between the biopsy and resection materials that were taken from the same patient, this result may not have been applicable in the evaluation of biopsy specimens only. this discrepancy is most likely owing to tissue heterogeneity. the overexpression of p53 that was found in 42% of the patients was of no prognostic significance. conclusions: these data provide evidence that overrexpression of cyclin d1 protein in resection material of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck is indicative of a poor prognosis, independently of other known prognostic factors. whether overexpression of cyclin d1 may therefore be used to select patients for more intensive treatment should be examined in the context of a clinical trial.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:497-502

antibiotic resistance. antibiotics are commonly viewed as the most important advance in the history of medicine. during the six decades that followed the introduction of sulfonamides there has been a continuous supply of new agents responsive to evolving resistance of prior pathogens and emerging new pathogens. it now appears that the microbes confronting clinicians in the 1990s pose challenges that are unprecedented in the recent past. there are examples in virtually every category: malaria, multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis, multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli, azole-resistant candida species, and metronidazole-resistant trichomonas. the two pathogens that are arguably the most important to otolaryngologists are vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the former is a nosocomially acquired pathogen that is especially prevalent in intensive care units and usually cannot be treated with antibiotics that have established merit. penicillin-resistant s pneumoniae is suddenly becoming a major problem in much of the world and its frequency in the united states is escalating at an alarming rate, especially in some geographic areas. this organism will require entirely new strategies for the empiric treatment of serious infections in which s pneumoniae is a documented or suspected pathogen. it is premature to say that traditional approaches to sinusitis and otitis need to be changed, but many suspect this will happen. one important lesson from this experience is that extensive antibiotic use and abuse has had some devastating consequences and many now believe that these are inevitable given current usage rates. the second lesson is that, although resistance seems predictable, specific patterns are not. virtually no one predicted the evolution of e faecium as an important pathogen, and penicillin-resistance by s pneumoniae curiously took four decades to happen.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:392-396)

the soft-tissue shaving procedure for removal of adipose tissue: a new, less traumatic approach than liposuction. objective: to introduce the soft-tissue shaving cannula, a new, precise alternative to conventional liposuction that embodies an entirely different method of softtissue extraction and that appears to be less traumatic and more precise than methods currently used in liposuction. design: nonrandomized, nonblinded comparison of the soft-tissue shaver and conventional liposuction devices in fresh cadavers, followed by clinical use of the liposhaver in selected patients undergoing cosmetic facial liposuction. interventions: conventional liposuction devices and the soft-tissue shaving cannulas in fresh cadavers (<8 hours old). a submental lipectomy and a melolabial fold liposhaving were performed in a clinical setting. outcome measures: subjective evaluation by the operating surgeons. results: the fat was cleanly shaved and the contour result was even, without dimpling or asymmetry. conclusions: our early experiences suggest that this new liposhaving technique may offer a precise, less traumatic alternative to conventional liposuction. fat can be shaved in an open fashion under direct vision. it does not rely on a vacuum seal. the soft-tissue shaving cannula shaves fat one layer at a time. the depth of each layer removed, the depth of soft-tissue injury, and the optimal settings and sizes for various procedures remain to be reported.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:1117-1120)

sound- and/or pressure-induced vertigo due to bone dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal. objectives to present symptoms, patterns of nystagmus, and computed tomographic scan identification of patients with sound- and/or pressure-induced vertigo due to dehiscence of bone overlying the superior semicircular canal. to describe anatomical findings and outcome in 2 patients undergoing plugging of the superior semicircular canal for treatment of these symptoms. design and setting prospective study of a case series in a tertiary care referral center. patients and results eight patients with vertigo, oscillopsia, and/or disequilibrium related to sound, changes in middle ear pressure, and/or changes in intracranial pressure were identified in a 2-year period. seven of these patients also had vertical-torsional eye movements induced by these sound and/or pressure stimuli. the direction of the evoked eye movements could be explained by excitation or inhibition of the superior semicircular canal in the affected ear. computed tomographic scans of the temporal bones identified dehiscence of bone overlying the affected superior semicircular canal in each case. disabling disequilibrium in 2 patients prompted plugging of the dehiscent superior canal through a middle cranial fossa approach. symptoms were improved in each case. one patient developed recurrent symptoms requiring an additional plugging procedure and developed sensorineural hearing loss several days after this second procedure. conclusions we have identified patients with a syndrome of vestibular symptoms induced by sound in an ear or by changes in middle ear or intracranial pressure. these patients can also experience chronic disequilibrium. eye movements in the plane parallel to that of the superior semicircular canal were evoked by stimuli that have the potential to cause ampullofugal or ampullopetal deflection of this canal's cupula in the presence of a dehiscence of bone overlying the canal. the existence of such deshiscences was confirmed with computed tomographic scans of the temporal bones. surgical plugging of the affected canal may be beneficial in patients with disabling symptoms.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1998;124:249-258-->

human papillomavirus expression and p53 gene mutations in squamous cell carcinoma. objectives: to determine the incidence of human papillomavirus (hpv) infection and p53 gene mutation expression in squamous cell carcinomas (sccs) of the oral cavity and tonsils, to correlate the presence of hpv and p53 gene mutation with known clinical and pathological features of scc, and to determine whether infection with hpv or the presence of p53 gene mutations are independent prognosticators of patient survival. design: to accomplish this goal, 58 patients with sccs of the oral cavity and 42 patients with sccs of the tonsils were randomly examined. the cases examined met the criteria of 5-year clinical follow-up, availability of complete staging information and treatment history, and the presence of paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. immunohistochemical tests were performed to identify the mutant p53 protein. human papillomavirus identification was accomplished with polymerase chain reaction, with confirmation via restriction fragment length polymorphisms. results: the incidence of p53 gene mutation expression for this series was 66%. human papillomavirus infection was found in 11 patients (11%). there was a trend toward increased p53 gene mutation expression with advancing stage of tumor in the oral cavity cancer group, although this was less evident in the tonsil cancer population. the p53 gene mutation status was found not to correlate with the histological grade of the tumor, patient age or sex, recurrence rates, or survival status. like p53 expression, there were no correlations found between the presence of hpv and age, sex, histological grade, or recurrence rates. however, a correlation did exist between hpv and survival status in the tonsil cancer group, with improved survival noted among patients with tonsil cancers infected with hpv compared with those not infected with hpv. a significant correlation existed with both p53 gene mutation status and hpv status with respect to alcohol and tobacco use. the presence of the p53 gene mutation positively correlated with increased tobacco and alcohol use, whereas infection with hpv predicted a significantly lower rate of alcohol and tobacco consumption. conclusions: human papillomavirus infection is an independent risk factor for the development of oral cavity and tonsil sccs in those patients with a relatively low alcohol and tobacco use history. conversely, there is a strong association between heavy alcohol and tobacco use and mutation of the p53 gene. neither p53 gene mutation nor hpv infection serve as prognosticators of tumor behavior in sccs of the oral cavity or tonsils, with the exception of improved survival noted among patients with tonsil cancers infected with hpv.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1230-1234

neuro-otological findings after radiosurgery for acoustic neurinomas. objective: to evaluate the neuro-otological complications in patients after radiosurgery for acoustic neurinomas. design: inception cohort, retrospective study. setting: university hospital. patients: a consecutive sample of 46 patients with acoustic neurinomas who underwent unilateral gamma knife radiosurgery at the university of tokyo, japan, between june 1990 and june 1994 were followed up by otolaryngologists for more than 3 months. intervention: gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery. main outcome measures: neuro-otological examinations including pure tone audiometry, auditory brain stem response, and caloric test. results: tumor growth occurred in 2 patients (4.3%). seven (18%) of the 38 patients with preserved hearing of any extent became deaf within 1 year. in cases of gradual hearing loss, the average deterioration rate was approximately 8 db per year. abnormalities of auditory brain stem response preceded deafness in 2 patients. caloric response, preserved before treatment in 13 patients, disappeared 4 to 13 months after treatment (median, 8 months) in 9 (69%) of them, whereas their hearing was preserved. delayed facial palsy and persistent trigeminal neuropathy occurred in 10 (22%) and 7 (15%) of the 46 patients, respectively. severe facial palsy tended to persist. conclusions: the rates of neuro-otological complications of radiosurgery are almost comparable with those previously reported from other institutions. the deafness within 1 year after treatment might be attributed to a lesion in the cochlear nerve. hearing loss did not parallel vestibular function loss. the persistent severe facial palsy contrasts with previously reported findings. considering the serious facial nerve complications that occurred in some of our patients, further study to disclose the risk factors for neurological dysfunction would be needed for radiosurgery to become a true, safe alternative to microsurgery.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1229-1233

noninvasive assessment of the intralabyrinthine pressure: a new technique applied to patients with x-linked progressive mixed deafness syndrome with perilymphatic gusher during stapes surgery. in this report, we describe the findings of a noninvasive assessment of the intralabyrinthine pressure in two patients from a family with x-linked progressive, mixed deafness syndrome in whom a perilymphatic gusher occurs during stapes surgery. the so-called tympanic membrane displacement measurement technique could be successfully applied in these two patients (from a total of five patients who were studied) because they still showed a stapedial reflex at 1 khz, which is mandatory for application of the tympanic membrane displacement measurement technique. the findings were compared with those of age-related control subjects and indicated a significantly elevated intralabyrinthine pressure in the two patients who were observed. the results suggest that the tympanic membrane displacement measurement technique may serve as a screening test in audiological diagnostic studies of perilymphatic hypertension.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:926-929)

isotretinoin therapy for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. retinoic acid has been advocated for use in several premalignant and malignant epithelial lesions of the head and neck, including benign recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, with varying results. we describe a 24-year-old man with extensive tracheoesophageal and bronchoalveolar papillomatosis that degenerated into squamous cell carcinoma. multiple endoscopic carbon dioxide laser excisions, at one point performed on a weekly basis, as well as a prolonged trial of interferon, failed to control the progression of his disease. isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) therapy (1 mg/kg per day) was instituted, with dramatic clinical, radiographic, and functional improvement. the patient experienced no significant toxic effects and required no endoscopic procedures over a 6-month period. we propose that isotretinoin may be an effective adjuvant therapy for aggressive respiratory papillomatosis.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1994;120:405-409)

unilateral sinonasal disease without bone destruction: differential diagnosis using diagnostic imaging and endonasal endoscopic biopsy. objective: to evaluate the diagnostic algorithms leading to minimal-access surgery in unilateral sinonasal disease without evidence of bone destruction. design: in selected patients, we assigned qualitative preoperative diagnoses by performing computed tomography (ct), magnetic resonance imaging (mri), and endonasal endoscopic biopsy and prospectively analyzed the results for 3 years, from 1992 to 1995. patients: of 278 untreated patients who complained of nasal and sinus-related symptoms and underwent ct examinations, 130 were found to have unilateral sinonasal abnormalities without detectable changes in the bone structure. results: accurate preoperative diagnoses were made using ct in 75% of the patients with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps and 85% of the patients with mucoceles. in the remaining patients, preoperative diagnoses for both diseases were made using mri. all fungal and vascular diseases were accurately diagnosed using mri alone. although neither ct nor mri were useful in the qualitative diagnosis of neoplasm, the presence of neoplastic conditions, except papilloma, was indicated by mri. using endonasal endoscopy, biopsy was an accurate diagnostic tool, with minimal tissue damage, in 88% of the neoplasms. conclusions: in differentiating untreated unilateral sinonasal disease without evidence of bone destruction, we conclude that ct is the first modality of diagnostic imaging and mri is more sensitive than ct in identifying fungal disease and angiofibroma. furthermore, mri is helpful when neoplasm is indicated, but it is not an accurate diagnostic tool. the endonasal endoscopic approach for obtaining pathologic specimens is a qualitative diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of sinonasal neoplasm.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:198-200

terminal duct carcinoma. having read with interest the article by lucarini et al titled "terminal duct carcinoma,"1 we wish to make the following comments.in 1985 and 1988, we published two articles on the subject of salivary duct carcinoma in major and minor salivary glands diagnosed in four patients.2,3 in two patients, the intraductal carcinoma was confined to the minor salivary glands. it is noteworthy that in one of the patients presented, the ductal minor salivary gland carcinoma was a second primary carcinoma that arose in the buccal mucosa 4 years after excision of the mouth floor had been done along with partial mandibulectomy because of an infiltrative ductal carcinoma of the sublingual gland.in the opinion of lucarini et al,1 a ductal carcinoma located in the minor salivary glands is a "lowgrade salivary adenocarcinoma." however, it is difficult to agree with the authors that bone invasion and neurotropism do

her-2/neu oncogene characterization in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. objective: to characterize the her-2/neu oncogene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) cell lines and tumor tissue specimens. design: molecular analysis of her-2/neu oncogene amplification and expression in hnscc cell lines by southern, northern, and western blot techniques, and her-2/neu oncoprotein expression in hnscc tumor tissue sections by immunohistochemical analysis. specimens: eleven hnscc cell lines, eight paired samples of frozen hnscc tumor tissue specimens and adjacent nonmalignant mucosa, and 38 paraffinembedded slides derived from hnscc tumor specimens (including those from which the cell lines were derived) were analyzed. results: southern blot analysis showed twofold her-2/neu gene amplification in two (18%) of the 11 hnscc cell lines, mda-1386 and tu-167. northern blot analysis showed messenger rna overexpression in the same two cell lines, and to a lesser degree in mda-1483. western blot analysis showed high levels of her-2/neu oncoprotein expression in two (18%) of the 11 cell lines (mda-1386 and tu-167), a moderate level of protein expression in one cell line (9%) (mda-1483), and low levels of protein expression in eight cell lines (73%) some her-2/neu protein expression was seen in all of the hnscc cell lines. immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissue sections from which the cell lines were derived corroborated the western blot results. western blot analysis of frozen primary tumor specimens showed her-2/neu oncoprotein overexpression in two (25%) of eight specimens. immunohistochemical analysis showed high levels of protein expression in six (16%) of the 38 tumor tissue slides, moderate levels in 12 (31%), and low levels in 20 (53%). conclusions: the her-2/neu oncogene is overexpressed in a subset of hnscc tumors and cell lines. the results from western blot and immunohistochemical analyses underscore a variable her2/neu oncoprotein expression in hnscc. gene amplification was observed in a few of the cell lines, suggesting a potential mechanism of oncoprotein overexpression. messenger rna overexpression, however, can be seen in the absence of gene amplification, indicating that transcriptional or posttranscriptional control mechanisms must be involved. further studies are indicated to determine the biologic role of her-2/neu expression in the clinical progression of these lesions and to further define the molecular basis regulating its expression.(arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1995;121:1265-1270)

clinical-severity staging system for oropharyngeal cancer: five-year survival rates. objective: to improve the classification and survival estimates for patients with oropharyngeal cancer by combining cancer symptom severity and comorbidity with the current tnm cancer staging system. design: retrospective medical record review using explicit coding criteria. setting: university medical center. patients and methods: two hundred ninety-six patients receiving initial treatment from january 1, 1980, to december 31, 1989. multivariate analysis identified patient factors that had a significant impact on 5-year survival. these patient factors, symptom severity and comorbidity, were combined with cancer stage to create a composite clinical-severity staging system. main outcome measure: five-year survival. results: the overall 5-year survival rate was 38% (111/296). survival by tnm cancer stage was 67% (18/27) for stage i, 46% (24/52) for stage ii, 31% (26/85) for stage iii, and 32% (43/132) for stage iv (¦Ö2=10.84; p=.001). when patients were grouped according to the clinical-severity staging system, survival rates were 70% (16 of 23) for stage a, 47% (71 of 152) for stage b, 27% (18 of 67) for stage c, and 11% (6 of 54) for stage d (¦Ö2=34.49; p=.001). conclusions: survival estimates can be improved by adding carefully studied and suitably defined patient variables to the tnm cancer stage. the current tnm cancer staging system for oropharyngeal cancer is based solely on the morphologic description of the tumor and disregards the clinical condition of the patient. cancer symptom severity and comorbidity have a significant impact on survival. continued exclusion of patient factors leads to imprecision in prognostic estimates and hinders interpretation of clinical studies.arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1997;123:1118-1124

parasitic nodule of the right carotid triangle. we present the case of a woman in whom intraoperatory examination of a laterocervical mass in the right carotid triangle (thought to be a glomus tumor) disclosed thyroid tissue. although the overwhelming majority of cases of "thyroid parenchyma in the laterocervical region" represent a lymph node metastasis from a primary occult thyroid carcinoma, the rare occurrence of a parasitic nodule, as in our case, must be considered. arch otolaryngol head neck surg. 1996;122:1409-1411
